[Dexmedetomidine use for postoperative adrenergic analgesia and sedation in abdominal surgery].

Comparative study of postoperative analgesia and sedation with trimeperidine and dexmedetomidine and their effects on haemodynamics and vegetative nervous system was performed. Assessment of analgesia and sedation during vagotonia (first part of the study) and hypokinetic type of haemodynamics (second part of the study) was carried out with visual analogue scale (VAS) and Richmond scale. Results of the study showed that dexmedetomidine is more effective and safer than trimeperidine for analgesia and sedation in patients with spontaneous breathing after abdominal surgery. Dexmedetomidine use allows keeping optimal type of haemodynamics and vegetative nervous system parameters on first day of postoperative period.
