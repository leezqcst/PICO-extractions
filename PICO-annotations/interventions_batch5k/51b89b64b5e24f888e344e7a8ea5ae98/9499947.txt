[Value of absorbable clips in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A randomized prospective study].

Most surgeons use metal clips in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of absorbable clips in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One hundred consecutive patients with symptomatic gallstones without complications were randomized into groups; group T had two metal clips (titan clip ETHICONR), group R (laproclipR Davis and Geck) had one absorbable clip applied on the cystic duct and cystic artery. The patients were followed for one year. There was no difference between the two groups concerning operative time, hospital stay and postoperative complications. The absorbable clips seem to be as effective as metal clips in providing hemostasis in cystic artery and in cystic duct ligation.
