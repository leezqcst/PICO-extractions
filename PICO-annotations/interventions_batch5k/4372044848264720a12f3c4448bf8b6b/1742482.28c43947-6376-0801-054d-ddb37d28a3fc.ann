T1	Intervention 192 670	To evaluate the effect of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) who were intolerant to zidovudine because of neutropenia, we performed a randomized, open-label study in which patients were assigned to one of two groups. Zidovudine was discontinued in group A patients before instituting GM-CSF treatment and was restarted in a graduated fashion over 4 weeks
