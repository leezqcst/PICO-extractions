T1	Intervention 0 107	Carpal tunnel release by limited palmar incision vs traditional open technique: randomized controlled trial
T2	Intervention 110 261	AIM To compare a limited palmar incision for carpal tunnel release (CTR) with a traditional open technique, which is still considered the gold standard
T3	Intervention 263 448	METHODS Seventy-two patients with a carpal tunnel syndrome were individually randomized into the trial (limited incision CTR) (n=36) and control group (traditional technique CTR) (n=36)
T4	Intervention 450 609	In the trial group, skin incision parallel to the thenar crease was made up to 2.5 cm in length, under an operating microscope and endoscopic transillumination
T5	Intervention 611 795	Skin incision in the control group began at the distal border of the carpal ligament, followed the longitudinal crease of the palm, and crossed the base of the palm in a zigzag fashion
T6	Intervention 797 1010	Three months after surgery, the patients were asked about symptomatic relief and intervals between the operation and return to their daily activities and work, and examined for scar tenderness and esthetic outcome
T7	Intervention 1012 1112	Distal motor latency, conduction velocity, scar length, scar width, and operation time were measured
T8	Intervention 1114 1228	RESULTS There were no differences between the two groups in symptomatic relief and electrophysiological parameters

In the trial group, skin incision parallel to the thenar crease was made up to 2.5 cm in length, under an operating microscope and endoscopic transillumination.

Three months after surgery, the patients were asked about symptomatic relief and intervals between the operation and return to their daily activities and work, and examined for scar tenderness and esthetic outcome. Distal motor latency, conduction velocity, scar length, scar width, and operation time were measured. RESULTS There were no differences between the two groups in symptomatic relief and electrophysiological parameters. Intervals between the operation and return to daily activities (median 5 days, range 2-15) were shorter in the trial group than in the control group (median 10 days, range 2-21; p<0.001), as well as the intervals
T10	Intervention 1114 1553	RESULTS There were no differences between the two groups in symptomatic relief and electrophysiological parameters. Intervals between the operation and return to daily activities (median 5 days, range 2-15) were shorter in the trial group than in the control group (median 10 days, range 2-21; p<0.001), as well as the intervals between the operation and return to work (median 15 days, range 5-45 vs median 30 days, range 10-60; p<0.001).
