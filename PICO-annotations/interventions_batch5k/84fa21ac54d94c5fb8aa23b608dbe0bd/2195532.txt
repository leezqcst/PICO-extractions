[Methodologic comparison of the polyfrequency oscillation method, transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement and body plethysmography in bronchial provocation with methacholine].

A bronchial provocation challenge test was conducted with 30 subjects using metacholin. In randomised sequence lung function analysis tests were carried out with the bodyplethysmograph (Raw, FEV1) and the polyfrequent oscillation method (resistance, reactance between 2 and 52 Hz), whereas the transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tc-PO2) was measured continuously. Correlations between the various parameters, the change of the values at PD60 sGaw in relation to the initial values, the interindividual variability and the reactivity were determined. Medium correlations were found for the oscillatory parameters and Raw, whereas for tc-PO2 and Raw the correlation was markedly lower. In terms of percentage the greatest change was found in reactance, in relation to the initial value, followed by Raw and FEV1. The interindividual variability resulted in the highest values for the reactance, followed by Raw and FEV1. Interindividual variability showed the highest values for the reactance before oscillatory resistance and Raw. In respect of reactivity, reactance also had the highest values. Overall evaluation showed that bodyplethysmography and the polyfrequent oscillation method (reactance or resonance frequency) are comparably sensitive.
