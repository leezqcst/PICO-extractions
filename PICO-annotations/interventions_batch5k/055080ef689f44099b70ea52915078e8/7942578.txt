Effects of a fish-oil and vegetable-oil formula on aggregation and ethanolamine-containing lysophospholipid generation in activated human platelets and on leukotriene production in stimulated neutrophils.

The effects of consuming a liquid formula containing either fish oil enriched in omega-3 fatty acids or vegetable oil enriched in oleic acid was evaluated in 20 male subjects randomly allocated into two groups over a 42-d period. A decrease in collagen-induced aggregation by using washed platelet suspensions was found in both groups after nutritional supplementation. A considerable rise in omega-3 and a decrease in omega-6 fatty acids occurred in the platelet phospholipid with fish-oil consumption. The degree of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) enrichment (fish-oil group) was dramatically greater in the ether-containing plasmenylethanolamine (13.5 mol% of fatty acids; mol% of fatty acids = moles per 100 moles of total fatty acids) than in phosphatidylethanolamine (2.8 mol%) or phosphatidylcholine (2.9 mol%). Neither treatment significantly influenced the agonist-induced accumulation of lysoplasmenylethanolamine as derived via phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of plasmenylethanolamine. HPLC measurements of eicosanoid production in A23187-stimulated neutrophils revealed a considerable decrease in the formation of arachidonic acid-derived leukotriene B4 (LTB4), by 41%, and 5-HETE (5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid), by 30%, in the fish-oil group along with the appearance of the corresponding EPA-derived products [LTB5 and 5-HEPE (5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid)]. No such alterations in the formation of lipoxygenase products were found with the vegetable oil treatment.
