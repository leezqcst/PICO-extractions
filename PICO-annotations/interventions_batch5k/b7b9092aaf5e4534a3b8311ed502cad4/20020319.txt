Randomized controlled trial for early intervention for autism: a pilot study of the Autism 1-2-3 Project.

We piloted a 2-week "Autism-1-2-3" early intervention for children with autism and their parents immediately after diagnosis that targeted at (1) eye contact, (2) gesture and (3) vocalization/words. Seventeen children were randomized into the Intervention (n = 9) and Control (n = 8) groups. Outcome measures included the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale, Symbolic Play Test, and Parenting Stress Index. Children with autism improved in language/communication, reciprocal social interaction, and symbolic play. Parents perceived significant improvement in their children's language, social interaction, and their own stress level. This intervention can serve as short-term training on communication and social interaction for children with autism, and reduce the stress of their parents during the long waiting time for public health services.
