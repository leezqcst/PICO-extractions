T1	Intervention 503 1023	We conducted a comparative, open-label trial in 310 adults with AIDS who had recently recovered from an initial episode of PCP and had no treatment-limiting toxic effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine. All the patients were treated with zidovudine and were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg of trimethoprim once daily or 300 mg of aerosolized pentamidine administered every four weeks by jet nebulizer. The participants were followed for a median of 17.4 months.
