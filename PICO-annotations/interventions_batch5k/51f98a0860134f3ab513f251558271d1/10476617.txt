Trial of prophylactic administration of TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, ozagrel hydrochloride, for preeclampsia.

OBJECTIVE In an attempt to investigate the prophylactic effect of a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor on pregnant women with a high risk of preeclampsia, the following clinical study was undertaken.
METHODS Forty pregnant women were randomly allocated to control or treatment groups. Ozagrel Hydrochloride (400 mg/day, orally) and placebo were started at 20 weeks of gestation and continued until delivery.
RESULTS Seventeen of 20 (85%) women in the control group developed preeclampsia, whereas 9 of 20 (45%) in the treatment group developed preeclampsia. Ozagrel Hydrochloride significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the occurrence of preeclampsia, and the incidence of both hypertension (p < 0.05) and proteinuria (p < 0.01) was significantly less in the treatment group compared with the control group. One month after administration, the mean plasma concentration of TXB2, a metabolite of TXA2, was significantly decreased (p < 0.01) to 62.4 +/- 13.6%, whereas that of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, a metabolite of PGI2, was significantly increased (p < 0.01) to 206.7 +/- 52.8%. There were no maternal or fetal side effects observed.
CONCLUSIONS It seems likely that Ozagrel Hydrochloride could be used for the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnant women.
