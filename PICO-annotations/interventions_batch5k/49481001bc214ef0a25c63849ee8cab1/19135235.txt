Probiotics prevent IgE-associated allergy until age 5 years in cesarean-delivered children but not in the total cohort.

BACKGROUND Less microbial exposure in early childhood is associated with more allergic disease later. Allergic children have a different fecal microflora, with less lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Beneficial effects regarding the development of allergy have been suggested to come through probiotic supplementation.
OBJECTIVE We sought to study the effect of probiotic and prebiotic supplementation in preventing allergies.
METHODS In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study we randomized 1223 mothers with infants at high risk for allergy to receive a probiotic mixture (2 lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria) or placebo during the last month of pregnancy and their infants to receive it from birth until age 6 months. Infants also received a prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide or placebo. At 5 years, we evaluated the cumulative incidence of allergic diseases (eczema, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma) and IgE sensitization.
RESULTS Of the 1018 intent-to-treat infants, 891 (88%) attended the 5-year visit. Frequencies of allergic and IgE-associated allergic disease and sensitization in the probiotic and placebo groups were similar: 52.6% versus 54.9% and 29.5% versus 26.6%, respectively, and 41.3% in both. No significant difference appeared in frequencies of eczema (39.3% vs 43.3%), atopic eczema (24.0% vs 25.1%), allergic rhinitis (20.7% vs 19.1%), or asthma (13.0% vs 14.1%) between groups. However, less IgE-associated allergic disease occurred in cesarean-delivered children receiving probiotics (24.3% vs 40.5%; odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23% to 0.96%; P = .035).
CONCLUSIONS No allergy-preventive effect that extended to age 5 years was achieved with perinatal supplementation of probiotic bacteria to high-risk mothers and children. It conferred protection only to cesarean-delivered children.
