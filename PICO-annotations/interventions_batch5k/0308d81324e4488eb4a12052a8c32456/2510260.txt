Rioprostil, a new prostaglandin E1 analogue, in the once-daily treatment for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence: a comparison with ranitidine.

The efficacy of Rioprostil (a new prostaglandin E1 analogue) is compared with that of ranitidine in the recurrence prevention of duodenal ulcer(s). Duration of treatment is 6 months. Ninety-seven patients received rioprostil, 600 micrograms once-daily orally, and 110 patients received ranitidine, 150 mg once-daily orally. On rioprostil, 14.9% of patients showed a relapse after 6 months compared to 10.1% on ranitidine. Diarrhoea occurred in 7 patients on rioprostil and 3 patients on ranitidine. Rioprostil given 600 micrograms daily in the evening is a highly effective treatment for the prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse, the efficacy not being significantly different from ranitidine 150 mg.
