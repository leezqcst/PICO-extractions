Effects of maternal and dietary selenium (Se-enriched yeast) on the expression of p34(cdc2) and CyclinB1 of germ cells of their offspring in goats.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of selenium on the expression of p34(cdc2) and CyclinB1 (two components of MPF regulating cell cycle) of germ cells of their offspring in goats. A herd of 119 Taihang Black Goats, which was randomly divided into 4 treatments, received experimental diet with different Se levels (from Se-enriched yeast) for 174d. The four treatments, fed with a basal diet, were supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 2 and 4 mgkg⁻¹ DM Se. Testis samples were collected from the young male goats of each treatment group at the end of the study (30d after weaning) for mRNA expression using real-time PCR and for protein expression by immunohistochemistry assay. Results show that a significant decrease was observed in mRNA expression of p34(cdc2) and CyclinB1 in the testis of Se-deficient (Group 1) and Se-excess (Group 4) animals compared with that in Groups 2 and 3. However, no significant changes were found in mRNA expression of p34(cdc2) between Se-deficient (Group 1) and Se-excess (Group 4). Also the immunohistochemistry assay detected similar results of protein expression of these two genes. These results suggest, that maternal and dietary Se-induced oxidative stress can modulate the mRNA and protein expression of the cell cycle related genes (p34(cdc2) and CyclinB1) in the testis of their offspring. In addition, Se deficiency and Se excess could prevent the completion of the cell cycle.
