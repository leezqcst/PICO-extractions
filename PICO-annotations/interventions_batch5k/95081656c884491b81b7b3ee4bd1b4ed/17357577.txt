[Effect of alpha dihydroergocryptine in patients with fibrocystic breast disease].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of alpha dihidroergocriptine in patients with fibrocystic mastopathy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with diagnosis of fibrocystic breast disease were included in a prospective longitudinal blind double, controlled with placebo study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: of treatment group A: Alpha dihidroergocriptine tablets of 10 mg, group B: Placebo, during 6 months. After to basal evaluation, the patients were revised in a monthly way evaluating the following symptoms and signs: mastalgia, mammary tension, presence of nodules, nipple secretion, and the presence of adverse events.
RESULTS 39 patients with alpha dihidroergocriptine and 38 with placebo. Mastodinia, a satisfactory response was observed in 100% of alpha dihidroergocriptine group vs 61.11% of placebo group (p = 0.0002). Mastalgia responded in 100% of alpha dihidroergocriptine group vs 64.86% of placebo group (p = 0.0003). Galactorrea responded 100% of alpha dihidroergocriptine group vs 93.33% of the placebo. The nodules in the group alpha dihidroergocriptine disappeared in 23.1% and in 21.1% of the placebo group. Ultrasound evaluation of the nodules did not show significant differences between both groups. Prolactin levels showed a decrease in the group treated with alpha dihidroergocriptine with an important difference between both groups at the end of the 6 months study period. There were not differences in the presence of adverse events between groups.
CONCLUSIONS Alpha dihidroergocriptine is effective in the treatment of fribrocystic breast disease with minimum adverse events when compared with similar drugs.
