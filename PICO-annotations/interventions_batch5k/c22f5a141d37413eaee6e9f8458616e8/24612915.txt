Intravenous lipid emulsion improves recovery time and quality from isoflurane anaesthesia: a double-blind clinical trial.

Recovery time and quality after general anaesthesia is important for patient safety. This study aimed to determine whether intravenous lipid emulsion could improve recovery profiles from isoflurane anaesthesia in adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-six patients were enrolled. After anaesthesia induction, inspired isoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain stable vital signs and the suitable conditions for operation. At the end of the operation, the isoflurane was discontinued, and either 2 ml/kg 30% lipid emulsions or 0.9% saline solution was administered intravenously. The time to eye opening, extubation and exit from the operation room was recorded, and the quality of recovery from anaesthesia was assessed. Sixty patients completed the study. The median time to eye opening and exit from the operation room was significantly shorter in the lipid emulsion group than in the saline group [15.5 (interquartile range 9.0) versus 20.0 (10.0) min., p = 0.01; 19.5 (8.3) versus 23.6 (6.3) min., p = 0.04, respectively], whereas the median time to extubation did not show any noticeable difference. The quality of recovery was better in the lipid emulsion group than that of the saline solution group with respect to drowsiness visual analogue scale score (p < 0.01), Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score (p < 0.01), Mini-Mental State Examination score (p = 0.04) and Modified Aldrete Post Anaesthesia Recovery score (p = 0.03). No serious adverse events were observed during the study period. In conclusion, intravenous lipid emulsion may effectively improve the recovery time and quality from isoflurane anaesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
