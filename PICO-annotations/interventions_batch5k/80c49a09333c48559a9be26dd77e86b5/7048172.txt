Non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas: treatment of localized relapses with chemo + radio + BCG-therapy.

16 patients with relapsing non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas considered as clinical stage I or II were treated by an association of chemo + radiotherapy and thereafter by maintenance BCG therapy. 5 of them were included in a randomized trial and have a significantly different disease-free survival from patients receiving the same treatment but without BCG. 11 were systematically treated by BCG and they also have a fairly good disease-free survival. Such a treatment appears to be of value in treating these patients and even probably of curing some of them.
