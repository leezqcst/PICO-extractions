Pilot study of imiquimod 5% cream as adjunctive therapy to curettage and electrodesiccation for nodular basal cell carcinoma.

BACKGROUND Curettage and electrodesiccation (C&D) is a widely used method to treat nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC). However, residual tumor is present immediately after the procedure in approximately 20 to 40% of cases. Imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier that targets Toll-like receptor 7, is currently approved for superficial BCC.
OBJECTIVE In a double-blind, vehicle-controlled study, the administration of imiquimod after C&D was investigated to determine if the combination regimen would reduce the frequency of residual tumor compared with C&D alone in patients with nodular BCC.
METHODS Twenty patients received three cycles of C&D followed by imiquimod 5% or vehicle cream once daily for 1 month as adjunctive therapy. The primary end point was the frequency of residual tumor. The secondary end points included the time to heal and cosmetic appearance.
RESULTS Twenty patients were randomized to the imiquimod (n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10) treatment group. At 8 weeks, the proportion of patients with residual tumor was substantially decreased with imiquimod therapy (10%) compared with vehicle (40%). Wounds in the vehicle group healed more quickly than those in the imiquimod group, although by 8 weeks, all excision sites were healed. The majority of scars in the control group were atrophic and hypopigmented, whereas most scars in the imiquimod group were flat and slightly pink.
CONCLUSION Imiquimod 5% cream once daily for 1 month as adjunctive therapy after C&D substantially reduced the frequency of residual tumor and improved the cosmetic appearance compared with C&D alone. These preliminary results suggest that further studies to investigate imiquimod adjunctive therapy are warranted.
