Postoperative analgesia with preoperative oral ibuprofen or acetaminophen in children undergoing myringotomy.

Previous studies have shown over 70% of children require analgesics following bilateral myringotomy and tube placement (BM&T). This double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the postoperative analgesic effects of preoperatively administered oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Forty three ASA I or II children age six months or older scheduled for elective BM&T were randomized to receive acetaminophen (paracetamol) 15 mg.kg-1, ibuprofen 10 mg.kg-1, or placebo. Postoperative pain was assessed using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) upon arrival to the PACU and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. CHEOP scores did not differ between the groups at any time. There was no difference in the number of children receiving rescue analgesia. This study showed no benefit of preoperatively administered oral ibuprofen 10 mg.kg-1 or acetaminophen 15 mg.kg-1 over placebo for the relief of postoperative pain in children undergoing BM&T.
