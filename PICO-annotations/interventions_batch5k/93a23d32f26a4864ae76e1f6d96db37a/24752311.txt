Association of PAX4 genetic variants with oral antidiabetic drugs efficacy in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of PAX4 variants with therapeutic effect of oral antidiabetic drugs in Chinese type 2 diabtes mellitus (T2DM) patients. A total of 209 newly diagnosed T2DM patients were randomly assigned to treatment with repaglinide or rosiglitazone for 48 weeks, and the therapeutic effects were compared. In the rosiglitazone cohort, rs6467136 GA+AA carriers showed greater decrease in 2-h glucose levels (P=0.0063) and higher cumulative attainment rates of target 2-h glucose levels (Plog rank=0.0093) than GG homozygotes. In the subgroup with defective Î²-cell function, rs6467136 GA+AA carriers exhibited greater decrements of 2-h glucose level and improvement of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P=0.0143). Moreover, GA+AA carriers were more likely to attain the target fasting and 2-h glucose level (Plog rank=0.0091 and 0.007, respectively). However, these single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed no effect on repaglinide efficacy. In conclusion, PAX4 variant rs6467136 was associated with the therapeutic effect of rosiglitazone in Chinese T2DM patients.
