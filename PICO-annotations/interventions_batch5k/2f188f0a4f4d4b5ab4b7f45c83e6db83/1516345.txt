Double blind comparison of Iomeprol 350 and Iopamidol 340 in intravenous digital subtraction angiography for peripheral vascular disease.

A randomized double blind study was undertaken to compare the diagnostic efficacy and side effects of a new non-ionic contrast medium Iomeprol with a commonly used one--Iopamidol. Visual and densitometric comparison was made of intravenous digital subtraction angiograms performed for peripheral vascular disease. The results show the two media to be similar both in imaging quality and in the incidence of associated side effects. Ninety-eight per cent of the intravenous digital subtraction angiograms were assessed as adequate for clinical management by the vascular surgeon.
