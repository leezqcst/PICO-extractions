Supplementation effect with slow-release urea in feed blocks for Thai beef cattle--nitrogen utilization, blood biochemistry, and hematology.

Four Thai male native beef cattle, initial body weight (BW) of 100 ± 3.0 kg were randomly assigned in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments with inclusion of urea calcium sulphate mixture (U-cas) in feed block (FB) at 0, 120, 150, and 180 g/kg dry matter (DM). Total intakes were increased with the increasing level of U-cas supplementation in FB and the result obtained the highest when supplementation of U-cas in FB at 180, followed by 150, 120, and 0 g/kg DM, respectively. Moreover, supplementation of U-cas in FB at 180 g/kg DM could reduce total N excretion (4.1 g/day), as compared to others treatments, while N retention and proportion of N retention to N intake were increased up to 6.9 g/day and 14.9 %, respectively. On the other hand, the blood biochemistry and hematological parameters were not different among treatments except concentration of plasma urea N, plasma glucose, and total blood protein were improved especially with U-cas supplementation at 180 g/kg DM in FB. In conclusion, supplementation of U-cas at 180 g/kg in FB improved feed intake, N utilization, and blood biochemistry in Thai native beef cattle fed on rice straw.
