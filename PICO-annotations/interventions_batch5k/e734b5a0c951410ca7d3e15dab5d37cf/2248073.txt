Moclobemide, imipramine and placebo in the treatment of major depression.

Moclobemide was compared with imipramine and placebo in the treatment of major depressive episodes in 75 outpatients. The dosage of moclobemide (25 patients) was 300 mg daily for the first 5 days, after which it could be increased to 600 mg. Imipramine (25 patients) was given in a dosage starting with 33 mg and gradually increased to 100 mg/day in the first 5 days, after which it could be further increased; 25 patients received placebo. Both drugs were equally effective as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the overall assessment of efficacy and the Zung Self-rating Scale, and clearly superior to placebo; there were no significant differences between the 2 active drugs. Moclobemide was better tolerated than imipramine, and was almost comparable to placebo in this respect.
