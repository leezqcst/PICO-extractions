T1	Intervention 0 135	Effect of treatment with paromomycin on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease--a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
T2	Intervention 137 825	The results of experimental and clinical studies support the hypothesis that gut-derived endotoxins might be of relevance for the development and course of alcoholic liver disease. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a nonabsorbable, broad-spectrum antibiotic on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Fifty patients with alcoholic liver disease (27 with cirrhosis, 23 without cirrhosis) were randomly assigned to receive either paromomycin sulfate (3 x 1 g/day) or placebo in a double-blind fashion for at least 3 weeks, and if possible 4 weeks. Endotoxin concentration, liver function tests, and other laboratory parameters were determined in weekly intervals
