Adjvant treatment of tongue and floor of the mouth cancers.

Since January 1974, 95 patients with anterior tongue and floor of the mouth cancers were included in a randomized trial. After stratification according to staging and initial treatment, one-third of the patients received chemotherapy for 2 years (methotrexate 400 mg followed by citrovorum factor 100 mg + bleomycin 60 mg/week, during the first 15 weeks), one-third of the patients received immunotherapy with weekly C. parvum injections during 2 years, while the remaining third did not receive any treatment. If adjuvant treatment seems to delay recurrence it did not significantly decrease the recurrence rate. Survival is also not signigicantly modified by adjuvant treatment and was better for patients with small tumors. Patients who previously received radiotherapy did not benefit from adjuvant therapy.
