T1	Intervention 116 739	We studied the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on cough responses to bradykinin (BK), substance P (SP) and citric acid in a double blind, random study on 10 hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Of these patients, five had reported cough with ACE inhibitors. Cough responses to citric acid were similar between patients with and without cough, and SP up to 10(-5) M did not cause cough in any of the subjects. BK caused cough at 13.4 +/- 1.2 (-log M) in 5 patients with cough associated with ACE inhibitors, but it did not cause cough at concentrations up to 10(-5) M in other 5 patients
