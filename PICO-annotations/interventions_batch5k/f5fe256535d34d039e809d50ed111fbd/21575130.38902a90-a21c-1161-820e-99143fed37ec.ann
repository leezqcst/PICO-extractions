T1	Intervention 162 765	Extensive research is currently ongoing to prolong the half-life of coagulation factors. One of these techniques is glycoPEGylation, which has also been applied to recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), resulting in a rFVIIa derivative (N7-GP) with a prolonged terminal half-life (t(1/2) ). The main clinical purpose of N7-GP is to provide safe and effective prophylaxis to patients with hemophilia and inhibitors. The prolonged t(1/2) of N7-GP can potentially reduce the dosing frequency and thereby facilitate convenience and compliance, which are two significant barriers to effective prophylaxis
