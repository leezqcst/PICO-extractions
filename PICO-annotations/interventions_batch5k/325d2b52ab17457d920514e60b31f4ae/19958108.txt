Comparison between obtained mydriasis in type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND/AIMS To evaluate and compare obtained mydriasis with phenylephrine 10% associated with tropicamide 1% in type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic patients.
METHODS A total of 50 patients (100 eyes) scheduled for fundoscopy were dilated with phenylephrine 10% and yropicamide 1% (group 0: n = 20 type 2 diabetic patients, 40 eyes, and group 1: n = 30 non-diabetic patients, 60 eyes). Only one drop per eye of each drug was administered. In both groups, pupil diameter was measured after 40 minutes of eye drops instillation.
RESULTS Both groups were similar regarding age (p = 0.06, Mann-Whitney test). Mean pupil diameter in group 0 was 8.57 and 8.73 in group 1. There was no statistic difference between both groups (p = 0.44). Pupil diameter was greater than 7 mm in all patients (100%).
CONCLUSION When an appropriate drug combination is used, diabetic patients can achieve mydriasis as satisfactory as non-diabetic patients, allowing adequate fundus examination and/or retinopathy treatment.
