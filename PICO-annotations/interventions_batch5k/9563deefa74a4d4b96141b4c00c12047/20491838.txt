Influence of bony defects on implant stability.

INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to analyze the evolution of implant mechanical stability in different types/sizes of bony defects using both Periotest and Osstell devices as "objective tools."
MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two implants were randomly allocated to one of the four types of bone defects: marginal bone loss, peri-apical bone defect, constant width dehiscence and constant length dehiscences. Periotest/Osstell measurements were completed before and during staged bone removal (to enlarge defect size).
RESULTS Significant differences (P<0.05) with initial values were found after a 2 mm marginal bone removal (Osstell/Periotest); for a peri-apical bone lesion, after removal of 5 mm (Osstell) or 8 mm (Periotest); for a 6-mm-long dehiscence, after removal up to 180 degrees of the implant perimeter (Osstell/Periotest); for a 3-mm-wide dehiscence, after removal of 10 mm (Osstell) or 6 mm (Periotest).
CONCLUSION Periotest and Osstell are in general not very sensitive in the identification of peri-implant bone destruction, except for marginal bone loss.
