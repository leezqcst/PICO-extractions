Fluticasone or montelukast in preschool wheeze: a randomized controlled trial.

INTRODUCTION Approximately 30% of children younger than 3 years experience at least 1 episode of wheezing. Antiasthmatic medication is routinely prescribed, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Our study was aimed to evaluate the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment on frequency and severity of preschool wheeze episodes (PWEs).
METHODS Children aged 6 to 36 months with the first up to the third PWE were randomly assigned to receive montelukast, fluticasone, or no treatment for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were the number of PWEs, the number of hospitalizations due to PWE, and the severity of respiratory symptoms. results: There were no significant differences in outcome measures between the groups. However, tobacco-exposed children treated with fluticasone had significantly fewer PWEs (P = .01).
CONCLUSION Neither montelukast nor fluticasone has proven effective in the prevention of PWE recurrence. Children of smoking parents may benefit from fluticasone treatment after PWE. This observation requires confirmation in larger studies.
