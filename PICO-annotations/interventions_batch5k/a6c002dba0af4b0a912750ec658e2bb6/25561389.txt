Does watching a video on third molar surgery increase patients' anxiety level?

OBJECTIVE To identify the effects of watching live taping of third molar removal on patients' anxiety levels before and after extraction.
STUDY DESIGN This study was based on a prospective, cross-sectional, observational investigation of the different patient education techniques about the effect of third molar removal on patients' anxiety level. A total of 333 patients were randomized into three groups: two study groups (for group 1, basic information was given verbally; for group 2, which was the study group, basic information was given verbally and through a movie on third molar extraction); and a control group (basic information was given verbally; it did not include information on operative procedures and recovery). Anxiety levels were assessed by using the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Pain was assessed with a visual analog scale. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 16.0.
RESULTS Group 2 patients were significantly more anxious before the surgical procedure, and the most significant decreases in DAS and STAI scores were observed in that group. The age, surgery time, and education level were not correlated with anxiety or pain levels; however, female patients had high levels of anxiety (P < .05).
CONCLUSION Preoperative multimedia information increases the anxiety of patients undergoing third molar surgery.
