Effects of misoprostol on human circulation.

Prostaglandins (PGs) of the E-type are potent vasodilators in most species and in most vascular beds. However, vasoconstrictor effects of PGEs have also been noted at selected sites. This study examined the effects of misoprostol, a PGE1 analog with antiulcer activity, on the human cardiovascular system. Twenty healthy subjects participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Following a 12 hour fast, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, light reflex plethysmography of the finger, resting blood flow volume in the lower arm and leg and peripheral vascular resistance were measured at 10 min. intervals for 1 hour prior to drug administration, to permit calculating baseline values. Misoprostol (400 mcg) or its matching placebo were administered orally, and the measurements were repeated at 10 min. intervals over the next 2 hours. A decrease in leg blood flow volume and a corresponding increase in leg peripheral vascular resistance were noted in the misoprostol group. A statistically significant decrease in heart rate between the two treatment groups was also noted. These small changes were not considered to be of clinical importance. No adverse experiences were reported. In conclusion, a single dose of misoprostol (400 mcg) has no clinically significant vasoconstrictive or vasodilative properties in man.
