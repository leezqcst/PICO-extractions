Eberconazole 1% cream is an effective and safe alternative for dermatophytosis treatment: multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative trial with miconazole 2% cream.

BACKGROUND Eberconazole is a topical, broad-spectrum imidazole derivative, effective in dermatophytoses, candidiasis, and pityriasis treatment. In previous trials, it showed a higher efficacy than clotrimazole in the treatment of dermatophytoses. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of eberconazole 1% cream compared with miconazole 2% cream in the treatment of dermatophytoses.
METHODS A multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial was performed in 653 patients with dermatophytoses, randomized to eberconazole 1% cream every 12 h or miconazole 2% cream every 12 h for 4 weeks. Treatment efficacy was assessed on the basis of the percentage of effective response after 4 weeks through mycologic and clinical assessment.
RESULTS Of the 653 patients included in the trial, 360 produced positive baseline mycologic cultures and were included in the efficacy assessment. Clinical efficacy was shown in 76.1% of patients receiving eberconazole and in 75.0% of patients receiving miconazole. The incidence of adverse events related to treatment was 0.91% for eberconazole and 0.92% for miconazole, none being serious, and all being local and transient.
CONCLUSIONS Eberconazole 1% cream is an effective treatment for fungal infections produced by dermatophytes, with a good safety and tolerability profile, and can be considered a good alternative for the treatment of dermatophytoses.
