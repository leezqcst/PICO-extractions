T1	Intervention 1146 1667	In the current investigation, changes in autonomic tone associated with long-term administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were measured using spectral analysis of heart rate variability in 13 patients with congestive heart failure who were enrolled in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril. Both placebo and treatment groups were balanced at baseline study in terms of functional class, ventricular performance and autonomic tone
