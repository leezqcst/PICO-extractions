T1	Intervention 507 1047	Before the experiment, 72 rats were randomly allocated to receive HBO or air treatment. With or without HBO pre-treatment, the rats were further divided into the following subgroups (n = 6): (i) LPS injection, (ii) normal saline (N/S) injection, (iii) hemin (a HO-1 inducer) plus LPS, (iv) hemin alone, (v) tin protoporphyrin (SnPP; a HO-1 inhibitor) plus LPS, and (vi) SnPP alone. All rats were maintained for 6 h and then sacrificed with a high-dose pentobarbital injection. Lung injuries and relevant enzymes expression were thus assayed
