Effect of supplementary antioxidant vitamin intake on carotid arterial wall intima-media thickness in a controlled clinical trial of cholesterol lowering.

BACKGROUND There is accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence of an association between anti-oxidant vitamin intake and reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Using data from the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS), we explored the association of self-selected supplementary antioxidant vitamin intake on the rate of progression of early preintrusive atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS CLAS was an arterial imaging trial in which nonsmoking 40- to 59-year-old men with previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomized to colestipol/niacin plus diet or placebo plus diet. The rate of progression of early preintrusive atherosclerosis was determined in 146 subjects using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound quantification of the distal common carotid artery far wall intima-media thickness (IMT). From the nutritional supplement database, 22 subjects had an on-trial average supplementary vitamin E intake of > or = 100 IU per day (high users) and 29 subjects had an average on-trial supplementary vitamin C intake of > or = 250 mg per day (high users). Within the placebo group, less carotid IMT progression was found for high supplementary vitamin E users when compared with low vitamin E users (0.008 versus 0.023 mm/y, P = .03). No effect of vitamin E within the drug group was found. No effect of vitamin C within the drug or placebo group was found.
CONCLUSIONS Supplementary vitamin E intake appears to be effective in reducing the progression of atherosclerosis in subjects not treated with lipid-lowering drugs while the process is still confined to the arterial wall (early preintrusive atherosclerosis).
