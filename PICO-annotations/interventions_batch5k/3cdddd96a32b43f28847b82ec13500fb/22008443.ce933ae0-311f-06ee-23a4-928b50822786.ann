T1	Intervention 367 1064	This randomized and controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of ischemic postconditioning on protection against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in TOF patients receiving cardioplegia. From January 2008 to June 2010, 80 consecutive children undergoing correction of TOF were enrolled and randomly assigned to either a postconditioning group (three cycles of 30 seconds of ischemia and 30 seconds of reperfusion using re-clamping and de-clamping starting 30 seconds after the initial de-clamping of the aorta, n = 41) or a control group (n = 39). Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was assayed preoperatively, and then 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 20 hours, and 48 hours after persistent reperfusion
