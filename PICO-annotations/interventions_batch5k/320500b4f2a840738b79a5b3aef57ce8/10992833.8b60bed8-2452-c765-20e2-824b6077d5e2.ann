T1	Intervention 103 456	We compared onset and offset of action and tracheal intubating conditions after rapacuronium and rocuronium in 60 patients in a randomized, assessor-blinded study. Following induction of anaesthesia with propofol 2.5 mg kg-1, either rapacuronium 1.5 mg kg-1 (n = 30) or rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 (n = 30) was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation.
