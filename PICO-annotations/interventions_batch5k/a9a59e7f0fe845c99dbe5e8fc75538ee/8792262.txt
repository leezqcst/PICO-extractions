The influence of nonhandicapped peers on the social interactions of children with a pervasive development disorder.

This study investigated whether or not children with autism or a related pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) can benefit from regular opportunities to interact with a normally developing peer, matched as to sex and age. An experimental design with random assignment of subjects to treatment and control groups was used to demonstrate the impact of this peer-mediated intervention. In the treatment group, we found significant improvements in the social behavior of the children with PDD. Several gains were also generalized to interactions with an unfamiliar nonhandicapped peer, to interactions with another child with PDD, and to the large school setting. In the untreated control group, no positive changes were observed. Results suggest that children with PDD can develop peer relations if appropriate social contexts are made available for them.
