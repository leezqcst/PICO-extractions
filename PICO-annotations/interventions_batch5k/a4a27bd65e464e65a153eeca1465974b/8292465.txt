The incidence of first-dose hypotension with quinapril in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

A total of 2242 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 95-120 mmHg) were randomised on a double-blind basis to receive a single dose of placebo, 5 mg quinapril or 10 mg quinapril. Patients were identified who: (a) met the blood pressure (BP) criteria for first-dose hypotension (sitting or standing systolic BP < 100 mmHg, or a fall in systolic BP > or = 20 mmHg on standing); (b) had symptoms suggestive of hypotension; and (c) met the BP criteria and had symptoms. In all three classifications there were no statistically significant differences between the incidences in placebo and combined active treatment groups, or between those in the two quinapril groups. No associated serious adverse events were reported. In the low-risk population studied, it would appear that the incidence of first-dose hypotension with quinapril is similar to placebo and is not dose-related.
