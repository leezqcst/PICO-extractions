[Clinical observation on different acupuncture and moxibustion therapies for treatment of postsurgical gastroparesis syndrome].

OBJECTIVE To optimize therapy of acupuncture and moxibustion for postsurgical gastroparesis syndrome (PGS).
METHODS Forty-one cases of PGS were randomly divided into 3 groups in order of visiting. Group A (n = 17) were treated by warming needle moxibustion, group B (n = 12) by acupuncture plus auricular point sticking, and group C (n = 12) by routine acupuncture. Changes of gastric drainage volume, therapeutic times and cured rate were investigated in the 3 groups.
RESULTS All the 3 therapeutic methods could significantly decrease gastric drainage volume. The cured rate was 100.0% and the therapeutic times was (7.24 +/- 3.87) in the group A, 66.7%, (9.83 +/- 4.60) times in the group B and 75.0%, (15.25 +/- 3.81) times in the group C, with significant differences in the cured rate and the therapeutic times among the 3 groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION The warming needle moxibustion is the best method for PGS, with less therapeutic times, high cured rate and rapid effect.
