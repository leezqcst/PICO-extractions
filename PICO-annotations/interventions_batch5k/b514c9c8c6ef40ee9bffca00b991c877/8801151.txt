Intraumbilical vein injection of prostaglandin F2 alpha in retained placenta.

A randomized protocol was used to study the effect of intraumbilical prostaglandin F2 alpha (Hembate, Upjohn) and oxytocin injection in women with retained placenta. Prostaglandin F2 alpha, 20 mg, diluted to 20 ml in normal saline solution (10 women, group 1), 30 IU of oxytocin, diluted to 20 ml in normal saline solution (11 women, group 2), or 20 ml of normal saline solution alone (7 women, group 3), were injected into the umbilical vein 1 h after delivery. Nine women (group 4, controls) underwent manual removal of the retained placenta. In group 1, placental expulsion occurred in all patients and the duration of the placental expulsion after prostaglandin F2 alpha injection was 6.8 +/- 1.36 (mean +/- SE) min: in group 2, six placental expulsions occurred after 13.3 +/- 1.97 min (mean +/- SE); and in group 3, no effect was recorded after intraumbilical saline injection. We suggest that intraumbilical vein injection of prostaglandin F2 alpha might be a beneficial, non-surgical method for treating retained placenta. Oxytocin might reduce the incidence of manual lysis of the placenta and achieve partial success.
