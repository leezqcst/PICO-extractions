Effect of testosterone and a nutritional supplement, alone and in combination, on hospital admissions in undernourished older men and women.

BACKGROUND In older people, undernutrition is associated with increased hospitalization rates and mortality. Because weight loss in older people often reflects a disproportionate reduction of skeletal muscle, anabolic treatments may be beneficial.
OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the hypothesis that testosterone treatment and a nutritional supplement have additive benefits.
DESIGN Oral testosterone undecanoate (40 mg daily for women, 80 mg twice daily for men) and an oral nutritional supplement (475 kcal/d) were administered, alone or combined, for 1 y to 49 community-dwelling, undernourished people [Mini Nutritional Assessment score <24 and low body weight (body mass index, in kg/m(2): <22) or recent weight loss (>7.5% over 3 mo)] aged >65 y (mean age: 77 y; 26 women and 23 men). Hospital admissions and other variables were assessed.
RESULTS In subjects receiving combined testosterone and nutritional supplements (n = 11), there were no hospital admissions, whereas there were 9 admissions (2 elective) in 13 subjects in the no-treatment group, 4 in the testosterone-treated group (n = 12), and 5 in the supplement-treated group (n = 13); P = 0.06 with no-treatment compared with combined treatment. When compared with the no-treatment group, the combined-treatment group had significantly fewer subjects admitted to hospital (0 compared with 5, P = 0.03), fewer days in hospital (0 compared with 74, P = 0.041), and a longer time to hospital admission (P = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS In undernourished older people, combined treatment with testosterone and nutritional supplementation reduced the number of people hospitalized and the duration of hospital admissions, which are important endpoints in this group. Larger, confirmatory studies are now needed. This trial was registered before commencement at clinical trials.gov as NCT00117000.
