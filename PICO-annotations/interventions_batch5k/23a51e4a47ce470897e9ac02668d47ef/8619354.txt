Iobitridol 300 compared to iopromide 300--a double-blind randomized phase-III study of clinical tolerance in total body CT.

UNLABELLED PURPOSE, MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical safety of iobitriodol 300 mg I/ml and iopromide 300 mg I/ml were compared in a randomized double blind phase-III study conducted on 60 patients undergoing abdominal CT for a variety of indications. Each examination was rated as diagnostic or nondiagnostic and the image quality was noted. Nature, onset, intensity as well as outcome of each adverse reaction were recorded.
RESULTS There was no significant difference in imaging quality and side effects between the contrast media. In this study, both iobitridol and iopromide provided excellent image quality and a low rate of side effects.
CONCLUSION Iobitridol is a safe and effective nonionic contrast agent for contrast-enhanced body CT.
