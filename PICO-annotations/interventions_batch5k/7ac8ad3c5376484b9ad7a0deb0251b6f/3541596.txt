Monotherapy of mild hypertension with nifedipine.

The effectiveness of nifedipine as first-line monotherapy for mild diastolic hypertension (range: 95 to 105 mm Hg) was tested in this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial. Fifty-six patients were enrolled and, after titration of the placebo or active drug, they were followed for 12 weeks. Significant declines in the sitting systolic and diastolic pressures of -19 +/- 4 mm Hg (standard error) and -13 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, were observed during this follow-up period. Overall, 75 percent of patients receiving active drug had diastolic pressures less than or equal to 90 mm Hg at the last treatment visit. Heart rate was not significantly changed in the sitting position during the treatment period, and the majority of patients (75 percent) showed a response to nifedipine doses of 10 or 20 mg orally three times daily in the capsule form. The levels of the systolic and diastolic pressures at entry were not predictive of the dose of nifedipine required for effective blood pressure control.
