Effects of two combined hormonal contraceptives with the same composition and different doses on female sexual function and plasma androgen levels.

BACKGROUND This study was conducted to compare the effects of two contraceptive pills with different doses of the same components, on plasma androgen levels and female sexual function among women without previous sexual dysfunction.
STUDY DESIGN The participants were randomized into two groups, to receive pills containing ethynylestradiol (EE) 30 mcg and levonorgestrel (LNG) 150 mcg or EE 20 mcg and LNG 100 mcg, for six cycles. Sexual function was assessed using a standardized questionnaire [Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)]. Hormone assays were performed at baseline and after the sixth cycle.
RESULTS Forty-nine women were included in the EE30/LNG150 group and 48 in the EE20/LNG100 group. EE30/LNG150 group presented 54% and 67% decreases of total testosterone and free androgen index, respectively, with statistical significance. EE20/LNG100 presented reductions of 20% and 42%, respectively, but without statistical significance. Both groups showed improvements in the FSFI "desire" score, but with statistical significance only for EE20/LNG100 group.
CONCLUSIONS EE30/LNG150 decreased plasma androgen levels, but there was no impairment in sexual desire, on the other hand, sexual desire score increased with EE20/LNG100 formulation.
