T1	Intervention 491 936	Pronuclear-stage human embryos were randomly divided and cultured in human tubal fluid medium (HTF) supplemented with either HSA (5 mg/mL) or Plasmatein (10%, v/v; 5 mg/ml) as a means of indirectly assessing the effect alpha- and beta-globulins have on embryonic development. Those results coupled with the known composition characteristics of Plasmatein were used as the starting basis to formulate test lots of synthetic serum substitute (SSS)
