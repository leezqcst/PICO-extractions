Comparison of comfort and local complications after cardiac catheterization.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 4 hours of bed rest versus 6 hours of bed rest on patients' safety, comfort, and satisfaction levels. Using a quasi-experimental design, the authors studied 118 left-heart catheterization patients who were randomly assigned to 4 hours or 6 hours of bed rest. Among the study participants, only 1 in the 6-hour group had significant bleeding. There were no complications in the 4-hour group. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of the other study variables. Given the lack of significant complications for the 4-hour group and similar comfort levels for both study groups, these findings suggest the feasibility of reducing the standard period of postcatheterization bed rest from 6 hours to 4 hours, thereby possibly lowering the cost of the outpatient procedure.
