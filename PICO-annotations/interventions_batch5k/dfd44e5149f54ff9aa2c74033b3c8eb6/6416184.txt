[Randomized study on the long-term adjuvant chemotherapy with ftorafur and mitomycin C for stomach cancer: second report].

In view of the usefulness of long-term adjuvant chemotherapy, the Cooperative Study Group of Surgical Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Gastric Cancer adopted as the second cooperative study a prospective randomized trial on three groups; MMC alone, Futraful alone and a combination of MMC and Futraful. In the group of Futraful alone the survival and disease-free rate were improved in three years after operation, especially marked in patients with the advanced stage. Moreover, the survival and disease-free rate in the group of the combination therapy were higher than those in the group of Futraful alone, and the relapse rate was lower in the former. Therefore, a long-term combined adjuvant chemotherapy with MMC and Futraful seems to be one of the most effective chemotherapy regimens for resectable advanced gastric cancer.
