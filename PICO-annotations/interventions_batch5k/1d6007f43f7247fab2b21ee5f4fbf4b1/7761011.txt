[Postoperative analgesia: peridural morphine versus sublingual buprenorphine. Comparative clinical study].

The authors herein present their personal series on the clinical evaluation of the analgesic efficacy of 2 opiodes, peridural morphine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) administered to group A patients, and sublingual buprenorphine (0.4 mg) administered to group B patients in the management of post-operative pain in major abdominal surgery. The study was conducted on 44 patients, both male and female, classified as ASA II and III. Statistical analysis of cardiovascular parameters (BP and cardiac frequency), respiratory frequency and pain score showed an overlapping progression among the two groups. Spontaneous pain decreased significantly to zero at T6 (p < 0.001). However, the necessity to administer buprenorphine more frequently after the sixth hour and the consequent increase in side effects, lead us to believe that the method used for group A patients is more advantageous.
