T1	Intervention 103 982	The ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes) trial is a large, prospective, randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of intensive with moderate blood pressure control on the prevention and progression of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). The secondary objective is to determine equivalency of the effects of a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the prevention and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists of two study populations: a hypertensive one (diastolic blood pressure of > or = 90.0 mm Hg at the time of randomization) and a normotensive one (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0-89.0 mm Hg at the time of randomization)
