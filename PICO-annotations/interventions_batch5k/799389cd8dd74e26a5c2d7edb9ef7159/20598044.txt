Comparison of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists in assisted reproduction cycles of polycystic ovarian syndrome patients.

AIM Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have reduced the incidence of severe ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) and rate of hospitalization due to severe OHSS, especially in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. The present study aimed to compare the outcomes of patients with PCOS undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with GnRH agonist versus GnRH antagonist protocols for assisted reproduction cycles.
METHODS The present clinical trial compared GnRH antagonist (cetrorelix) and GnRH agonist (buserelin) protocols during COH of 112 infertile PCOS patients entering assisted reproduction cycles. The primary outcome measure was pregnancy occurrence. Basal characteristics of the participants, stimulation cycle responses, pregnancy outcomes, incidence of OHSS and types of OHSS were considered in both groups.
RESULTS Regarding chemical and clinical pregnancy rates, the number of retrieved oocytes was significantly higher and OHSS was significantly lower in the antagonist group. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, number of follicles, number of follicles >18 mm, relative frequency of mature oocytes, number and days of gonadotropin injections, day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration, estradiol level and abortion were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSION GnRH antagonists are more effective, safe and a well tolerated alternative to agonists for assisted reproduction cycles in PCOS patients. GnRH antagonists are associated with a reduction in the incidence of OHSS in these patients.
