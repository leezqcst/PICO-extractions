T1	Intervention 0 324	Three-year clinical outcome after primary stenting of totally occluded native coronary arteries: a randomized comparison of bare-metal stent implantation with sirolimus-eluting stent implantation for the treatment of total coronary occlusions (Primary Stenting of Totally Occluded Native Coronary Arteries [PRISON] II study)
T2	Intervention 585 793	sirolimus-eluting Cypher stents (SESs) (Cordis, a Johnson & Joshson Company, Miami Lakes, FL) (100 patients) or bare-metal BxVelocity stents (BMSs) (Cordis) (100 patients) were followed clinically for 3 years
T3	Intervention 991 1158	7% in the SES group versus 27% in the BMS group (P < .001); and target vessel revascularization was seen in 11% in the SES group versus 30% in the BMS group (P = .002)
T4	Intervention 1459 1732	Clinical outcome up to 3 years after implantation of SESs for total coronary occlusions continues to demonstrate a significant reduction in adverse clinical events compared with BMSs without the evidence for either disproportionate late restenosis or late stent thrombosis.
