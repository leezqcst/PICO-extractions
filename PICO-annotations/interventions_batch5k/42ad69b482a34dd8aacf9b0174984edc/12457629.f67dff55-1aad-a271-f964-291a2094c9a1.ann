T1	Intervention 20 32	azithromycin
T2	Intervention 494 505	HPLC method
T3	Intervention 913 1048	AUC, 1318 hx microg g(-1) vs 2502 hx microg g(-1)) and peak tissue concentration (9.13+/-0.53 microg g(-1) vs 17.85+/-2.4 microg g(-1))
T4	Intervention 579 703	sustained concentrations of the drug were detectable at the last sampling time (204 h) in lung tissue and bronchial washing,
T5	Intervention 1439 1580	azithromycin is increased by doubling the dose, which results in favorable pharmacokinetic profile of the drug in the lower respiratory tract
