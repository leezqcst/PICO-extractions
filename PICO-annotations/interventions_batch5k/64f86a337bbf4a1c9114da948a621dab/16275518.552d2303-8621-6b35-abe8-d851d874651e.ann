T1	Intervention 47 102	right ventricular myocardial isovolumic relaxation time
T2	Intervention 105 180	Right ventricular (RV) blood pool-derived isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT)
T3	Intervention 380 463	myocardial velocity imaging-derived RV IVRT (IVRT') against invasively measured PAP
T4	Intervention 465 560	Transthoracic echocardiography with myocardial velocity imaging and right heart catheterization
T5	Intervention 620 747	Blood pool IVRT and myocardial IVRTs for the tricuspid valve annulus ring, basal and apical RV free wall segments were measured
T6	Intervention 818 832	Measured IVRTs
T7	Intervention 991 1082	systolic PAP and the heart rate-corrected IVRT' derived from the basal RV free wall segment
T8	Intervention 1088 1182	basal segment IVRT' corrected for heart rate correlates well with the invasive PAP measurement
T9	Intervention 1268 1327	alternative to tricuspid regurgitation-derived PAP systolic
T10	Intervention 1386 1415	method to derive systolic PAP
