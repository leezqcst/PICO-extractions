[Antiinflammatory potential of seven plant extracts in the ultraviolet erythema test. A randomized, placebo-controlled study].

BACKGROUND Phytotherapeutics are widely used in medicine. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the antiinflammatory potential of seven medical plant extracts using the ultraviolet- (UV)-erythema test.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Randomized, placebo-controlled study on 40 healthy subjects. Test areas on the upper back were irradiated with the 1.5 fold UV-B minimal erythema dose (MED). Formulations of Aloe vera, Chamomilla recutita, Hamamelis virginiana, Melissa officinalis, Mentha arvensis, Melaleuca alternifolia, Coriandrum sativum as well as 1% hydrocortisone acetate and 0.1% betamethasone valerate as positive controls and unguentum leniens as vehicle control were applied under occlusion on the irradiated areas and on non-irradiated area on the contralateral side. Photometric assessment of the erythema was performed before the application of the substances (t0), at 24 h (t1) and at 48 h (t2).
RESULTS Aloe vera, Chamomilla recutita, Melissa officinalis, Melaleuca alternifolia and Coriandrum sativum showed an antiinflammatory effect compared to UV-control and unguentum leniens. However, the results were only statistically significant for Aloe vera. All tested plant extracts were well tolerated.
CONCLUSION Aloe vera possesses an antiinflammatory effect on UV-induced erythemas.
