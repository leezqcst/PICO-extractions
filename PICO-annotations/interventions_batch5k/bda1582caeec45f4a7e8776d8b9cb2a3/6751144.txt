Epidural morphine in the elderly. A controlled trial after upper abdominal surgery.

The effectiveness of epidurally administered morphine in the relief of pain after upper abdominal surgery was assessed in a controlled study involving 20 patients aged 61 to 78 years. Analgesia provided by epidural morphine was comparable to that obtained in matched patients given an intramuscular regime. The total dose required by the epidural route was less than one-fifth that required intramuscularly, and sedation was correspondingly reduced. Postoperative respiratory mechanics, however, were not significantly improved and delayed respiratory depression was observed in one patient. It is concluded that in elderly patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery the risks related to the use of morphine by the epidural route outweigh the marginal advantages it may offer over conventional analgesic techniques.
