The efficacy of a herbal-based toothpaste on the control of plaque and gingivitis.

A double-blind controlled clinical trial with parallel groups was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a herbal-based toothpaste in the control of plaque and gingivitis as compared with a conventional dentifrice. 70 subjects with gingivitis completed the 6-week study. All participants had at least 20 natural teeth with no probing depths greater than 3 mm and a plaque index of 2 or more at baseline. At baseline, both groups were balanced for the parameters measured: plaque index, plaque vitality, gingival index, bleeding on probing and gingival crevicular fluid flow. At the end of the trial, there were reductions within both groups, however, there were no significant differences between the groups. It was concluded that the herbal based toothpaste was as effective as the conventionally formulated dentifrice in the control of plaque and gingivitis.
