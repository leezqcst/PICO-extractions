Treatment of Wilms' tumor. Results of the Third National Wilms' Tumor Study.

The Third National Wilms' Tumor Study sought to reduce treatment for low-risk patients and find better chemotherapy for those at high risk for relapse. Eligible patients (1439) were randomized according to stage (I-IV) and histology (favorable [FH] or unfavorable [UH]), and contributed data to survival and relapse-free survival (RFS) analyses. Four-year (postnephrectomy) survival percentages and randomized treatment regimens for low-risk patients were 96.5% for 607 Stage I/FH patients who received dactinomycin (Actinomycin D [AMD], Merck Sharp & Dohme, West Point, PA) and vincristine (VCR) for 10 weeks versus 6 months; 92.2% for 278 Stage II/FH patients; and 86.9% for 275 Stage III/FH patients who received AMD + VCR +/- Adriamycin (ADR, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) for 15 months. Stage II/FH patients also had either zero or 2000 cGy irradiation (RT) postoperatively and Stage III/FH patients either 1000 or 2000 cGy. Four-year survival was 73.0% for 279 high-risk patients (any Stage IV, all UH) who received postoperative radiation therapy (RT) and AMD + VCR + ADR +/- cyclophosphamide (CPM). Statistical analysis of survival and RFS experience shows that the less intensive therapy does not worsen results for low-risk patients and CPM does not benefit those at high risk.
