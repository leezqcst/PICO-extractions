[Carbohydrate substitutes: comparative study of intestinal absorption of fructose, sorbitol and xylitol].

BACKGROUND The carbohydrate substitutes fructose, sorbitol and xylitol are gaining more and more importance in the production of dietary food. But they can provoke gastrointestinal side-effects. In a randomized double blind study the rate of malabsorption of these sugars was compared and the concomitant symptoms were recorded.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS 25 healthy controls received 25 g of each sugar within 3 consecutive days. The intestinal absorption was determined by H2-exhalation tests and the clinical symptoms were recorded.
RESULTS The rate of malabsorption was 84% for sorbitol, 36% for fructose and 12% for xylitol (p < 0.01 for sorbitol versus fructose and xylitol). 57% of the participants with pathological H2-test after sorbitol and 56% after fructose reported symptoms, while all of the 3 malabsorbers of xylitol were symptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS There is an advantage to administering xylitol and fructose with regard to the intestinal absorption and concomitant symptoms as compared with sorbitol. H2-exhalation tests appear to be a reliable diagnostic tool to detect carbohydrate malabsorption and should find broader application in patients suffering from non-specific abdominal complaints.
