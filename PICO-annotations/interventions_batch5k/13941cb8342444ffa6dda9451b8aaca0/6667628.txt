Comparison of the hypotensive effects of bendrofluazide, bumetanide and xipamide.

A randomized, triple crossover study was carried out in 24 elderly patients requiring chronic diuretic therapy to assess the different hypotensive effects of a fixed daily dose of 5 mg bendrofluazide, 1 mg bumetanide and 40 mg xipamide. Each treatment was given for 3 months. The results showed that no significant weight change took place during the study period. There was, however, a significant (p less than 0.001) decrease compared to baseline values both in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the xipamide period and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) when taking bumetanide. Only minor side-effects were reported.
