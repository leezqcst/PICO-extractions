Airway management training using the laryngeal mask airway: a comparison of two different training programmes.

Nurses without prior experience in the use of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) were randomly allocated to one of two groups to be trained in the emergency technique of insertion of an LMA. Group A (32 nurses) were trained only on a manikin and group B (20 nurses) were trained on a manikin and with live anaesthetised patient practice in theatre (five successful insertions). Without further practice, both groups were asked to insert an LMA in a live patient in theatre 3 months after initial training. Three attempts per nurse were allowed. In group A, 75% passed the LMA successfully at the first attempt, 22% at the second attempt and 3% (one nurse) at the third attempt. In group B, 80% were successful at first attempt and 20% at the second attempt. Skill performance and retention were shown to be high following either training method, with no significant difference between the performance of either group (chi 2). We have shown that manikin-only training in the emergency technique for LMA insertion is as effective as live patient training. It is proposed that manikin training alone may be adopted as a future training modality if, as is expected, the use of the LMA in resuscitation becomes more commonplace.
