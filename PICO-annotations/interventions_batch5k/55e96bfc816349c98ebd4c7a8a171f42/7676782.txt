Comparison of eltanolone and thiopental in anaesthesia for termination of pregnancy.

Eltanolone, a new steroid hypnotic, was compared to thiopental in short anaesthesia. Sixty unpremedicated, Asa 1-2 women were randomized to receive eltanolone 0.6 (group E1) or 0.8 mg.kg-1 (group E2) or thiopental 4 mg.kg-1 (group T) for induction of anaesthesia. One minute before induction glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and alfentanil 15 micrograms.kg-1 i.v. were administered. If induction failed, additional boluses of the test drug were given. Anaesthesia was maintained with 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen, and additional bolus doses of the test drug were given in a standardized fashion, if needed. Recovery was assessed by a research nurse blinded to the agent used. Mean +/- s.d. induction doss were 0.7 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1 (group E1), 0.8 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1 (group E2) and 4.0 +/- 0.0 mg.kg-1 (group T). Induction time was prolonged in the group E1 compared to the other two groups (P < 0.05). Side effects were few in all groups, but involuntary muscle movements or hypertonus occurred in 23% of the patients in the eltanolone and in 3% in the thiopental groups (n.s). Early recovery (eye opening, orientation and sitting) was slower in both eltanolone groups compared to the thiopental group (P < 0.01). No differences between the groups were found in toleration of oral fluids, walking, voiding, postoperative analgesic requirements or postoperative nausea and vomiting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
