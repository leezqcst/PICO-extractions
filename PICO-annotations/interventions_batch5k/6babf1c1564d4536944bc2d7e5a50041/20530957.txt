Comparison of inguinal approach, scrotal sclerotherapy and subinguinal antegrade sclerotherapy in varicocele treatment: a randomized prospective study.

We compared outcome and complications of three simple varicocelectomy techniques. Groups were divided according to whether they would receive the Ivanissevich technique (n = 55), Tauber's technique (n = 51) or subinguinal sclerotherapy (n = 49). Selection criteria were: infertility >1 year, subnormal semen, sonographic diameter of veins >3 mm and time of regurge >2 s. Patients were randomly assigned to the groups of treatment, with follow-up every 3 months for 1 year. Improvement was only in sperm count and total motility for all groups. Pregnancy rates were 20, 13.73 and 12.24%, respectively, with no significant difference between groups. Hydrocele occurred only in the group which received the Ivanissevich technique (5.5%). Tauber's technique is simple; however, it has the disadvantage of multiple branching of small veins.
