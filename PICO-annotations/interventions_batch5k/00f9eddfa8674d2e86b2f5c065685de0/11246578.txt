Work-related stress and early atherosclerosis.

The purpose of this study was to examine the link between work-related stress and early atherosclerosis as measured by common carotid artery intima-media thickness and focal lesions in the common carotid artery and bifurcation. Four hundred sixty-seven members of an occupational cohort (total N = 573) were examined via questionnaires and B-mode ultrasound. We used multiple linear and logistic models to regress lesion risk and intima-media thickness on work-related stress scores from a questionnaire administered at an 18-month follow-up examination. In an age-adjusted model, the prevalence of carotid lesions among men scoring in the highest stress quintile was 36% compared with 21% among men in the lowest quintile. We also observed an increase in intima-media thickness in the highest quintile relative to the lowest (difference = 0.048 +/- 0.025 mm) among men. Among women, stress was not related to the prevalence of lesions or intima-media thickness. These findings suggest that men with greater work-related stress are at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease. Women in this age group may be protected from such effects, or current work-place questionnaires may not accurately assess stress in women.
