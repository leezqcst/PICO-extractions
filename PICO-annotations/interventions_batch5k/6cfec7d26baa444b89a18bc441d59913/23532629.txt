Erythropoietin treatment in chemotherapy-induced anemia in previously untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer patients.

BACKGROUND The impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chemotherapy-induced anemia has been a constant topic of debate over recent years. We prospectively assessed the efficacy of epoetin beta (Epo-b) in improving hemoglobin (Hb) levels and outcome in patients within an open label, randomized clinical phase II trial with advanced or metastatic gastric/esophagogastric cancer.
METHODS Previously untreated patients were randomized to receive 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) bid) for 14 days plus on day 1 either irinotecan 250 mg/m(2) or cisplatin 80 mg/m(2). Epo-b (30000 IU once weekly) was initiated in patients with Hb <11 g/dl and continued until Hb ≥12 g/dl was reached. If after 4 weeks the Hb increase was <0.5 g/dl, Epo-b was increased to 30000 IU, twice weekly.
RESULTS Of 118 patients enrolled, 32 received Epo-b treatment; of these, 65 % achieved an increase in Hb levels of at least 2 g/dl, with 74 % achieving the target Hb of ≥12 g/dl. Within the study population, patients receiving Epo-b showed better overall survival (median 14.5 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.056) as well as a significantly improved disease control rate (78 vs. 55 %, P = 0.025). Patients in the irinotecan group profited significantly (P < 0.05) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival under Epo-b treatment (median 6.5 vs 4.1 months and median 15.4 vs 8.4 months, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS Epo-b was effective in raising Hb levels in patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer. Patients receiving Epo-b had a significantly increased response to chemotherapy and a clear trend to improved survival.
