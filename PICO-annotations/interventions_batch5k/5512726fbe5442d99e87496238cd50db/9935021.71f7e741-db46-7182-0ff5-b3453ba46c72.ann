T1	Intervention 153 356	A long-term follow-up study with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging was undertaken to detect the morphological onset and to establish the early diagnosis in apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
T2	Intervention 892 1381	The criteria for the spadelike configuration defined on left ventricular short-axis NMR images were as follows: (apical maximal thickness > or = 15 mm), (apical anterior thickness over basal anterior thickness > or = 1.3) and (apical posterior thickness over basal posterior thickness > or =1.3). Thirteen patients who had predominant hypertrophy (> or = 15 mm) at the apical level without the spadelike configuration underwent NMR imaging twice before and after 54+/-10 months' follow-up.
