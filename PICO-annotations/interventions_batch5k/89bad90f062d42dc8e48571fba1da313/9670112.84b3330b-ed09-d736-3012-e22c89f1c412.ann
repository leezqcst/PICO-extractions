T1	Intervention 261 849	Patients were randomised in two groups: the training group (n = 21), staying in Cardiac Rehabilitation Department and the control group (n = 11), discharged home for 3 weeks. Each group received identical dietary instructions. The training group performed exercises every day: on bicycle ergometer during 30 minutes (5 times a week), overall-conditioning exercises for 30 minutes daily and 30 to 60 minutes of walking each day. Before administering of the therapy and 3 weeks later all MI patients performed the bicycle ergometer exercise test until the ventilatory threshold was reached.
