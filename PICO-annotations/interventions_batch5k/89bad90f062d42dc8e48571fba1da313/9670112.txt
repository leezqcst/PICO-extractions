Glucosamine in serum of patients after myocardial infarction subjected to rehabilitation training.

This paper presents results of 3 weeks physical training on glucosamine level in serum of male patients after myocardial infarction (MI) aged between 38 and 61. Patients were randomised in two groups: the training group (n = 21), staying in Cardiac Rehabilitation Department and the control group (n = 11), discharged home for 3 weeks. Each group received identical dietary instructions. The training group performed exercises every day: on bicycle ergometer during 30 minutes (5 times a week), overall-conditioning exercises for 30 minutes daily and 30 to 60 minutes of walking each day. Before administering of the therapy and 3 weeks later all MI patients performed the bicycle ergometer exercise test until the ventilatory threshold was reached. Before that test and 3 minutes after its termination capillary and venous blood samples were drawn. In the capillary blood samples indices of acid-base balance, lactate level, and glucose level were determined. In venous blood samples the serum levels of immunoreactive insulin, C-peptide and glucosamine were determined as well as binding of 125I-insulin to erythrocyte receptors. Obtained results show that administered therapy increased physical fitness and decreased of glucosamine concentration, insulinaemia and insulin resistance.
