Isoflurane and propofol for long-term sedation in the intensive care unit. A crossover study.

Propofol and isoflurane have been reported recently to offer better sedation than alternative agents in patients who require long-term ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit. This is the first report of a direct comparison between propofol and isoflurane. Twenty-four patients predicted to require artificial ventilation for at least 48 h were entered into a randomised crossover study to monitor sedation quality and time to recovery from sedation. There were no significant differences between the two agents in either end-point, with over 95% optimal sedation achieved by the use of each drug. Few adverse events were noted. Technological advances in the administration of volatile agents as long-term sedatives in the Intensive Care Unit may facilitate their more widespread use.
