Moisture-vapour-permeable film as an outpatient burn dressing.

This study compares a moisture-vapour-permeable film (MVPF) with silver sulphadiazine in a randomized prospective manner for the treatment of outpatient burns. The two treatment groups were closely matched in age, sex, per cent of BSA burned, and in burn severity and locations. The MVPF group demonstrated a 39.0 per cent greater reduction in pain after application of the dressing over the silver sulphadiazine group. Patients in the MVPF film group also reported significantly less difficulty in wound care and in dressing interference with their daily functions. The clinical infection rate and time to healing were similar in both groups. In the management of outpatient burns, MVPF was found to be superior to silver sulphadiazine.
