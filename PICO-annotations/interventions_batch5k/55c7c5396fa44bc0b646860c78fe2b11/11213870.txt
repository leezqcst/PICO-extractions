Beneficial effects of a soy-based dietary supplement on lipid levels and cardiovascular risk markers in type 2 diabetic subjects.

OBJECTIVE Consumption of soy protein has recently been shown to improve the blood lipid levels in nondiabetic subjects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a dietary supplement of soy protein, isoflavones, and cotyledon fiber (Abalon) affects cardiovascular risk markers, blood glucose, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetic subjects.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty type 2 diabetic subjects participated in a crossover trial. They were randomized to double-blind supplementation for 6 weeks with Abalon (soy protein [50 g/day] with high levels of isoflavones [minimum 165 mg/day] and cotyledon fiber [20 g/day]) or placebo (casein [50 g/day] and cellulose [20 g/day]), separated by a 3-week wash-out period.
RESULTS The results are expressed as means +/- SD. The percentage mean treatment difference between Abalon and placebo demonstrated significantly lower mean values after Abalon for LDL cholesterol (10 +/- 15%, P < 0.05), LDL/UHDL ratio (12 +/- 18%, P < 0.05), apolipoprotein (apo) B100 (30 +/- 38%, P < 0.01), triglycerides (22 +/- 10%, P < 0.05), and homocysteine (14 +/- 21%, P < 0.01), whereas the total cholesterol value tended to be less significant but still lower (8 +/- 15%, P < 0.08). No change occurred in HDL cholesterol, apo B100/apo A1 ratio, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, factor VIIc, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, lipoprotein(a), glucose, HbA1c, or 24-h blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS These results indicate beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with Abalon on cardiovascular risk markers in type 2 diabetic subjects. This improvement is seen even in individuals with near-normal lipid values.
