A Randomized Double Blind Clinical Trial on a Sabgh Formulation for Patients With Vitiligo.

BACKGROUND The cosmetic problem that vitiligo produces affects patients psychologically. Many patients with vitiligo are suggested to cover their white skin patches with cosmetic products. There are formulations in traditional Iranian pharmacy to color these white skin patches. In this study, one of these formulations was compared with a cosmetic formulation.
METHODS Two groups of patients were selected. One group used a marketed formulation and other group used a traditional Iranian Pharmacy formulation. The quality of life of the patients was compared based on the Dermatology Life Quality Index Questionnaire.
RESULTS Both interventions were associated with statistically improved Dermatology Life Quality Index scores over the 8-week intervention (P < .05), although the difference between the 2 was not statistically significant (P = .436).
CONCLUSION Traditional Iranian Pharmacy formulation is effective in increasing the quality of life in vitiligo patients.
