An exploratory study: the use of paroxetine for methamphetamine craving.

Methamphetamine abuse and dependence are growing problems nationally and worldwide. There are currently no effective pharmocologic treatments. Animal studies with SSRI's suggest that serotonergic modulation alters methamphetamine's behavioral effects. This exploratory study is a trial of the effects of the SSRI paroxetine versus placebo (in a double blind design) on craving and use in a population of methamphetamine users. Many subjects dropped out of the study, but those in active treatment who completed the eight week trial had a decrease in methamphetamine craving compared to the placebo treatment as measured by the OCDS modified for use in this population. Statistical analyses were not performed due to the low number of subjects. The preliminary data suggest that serotonergic agents may play a role in the effective treatment of methamphetamine abuse and dependence within the context of other effective behavioral interventions.
