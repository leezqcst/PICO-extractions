[Efficacy of combination with granisetron and methylprednisolone for nausea, vomiting and appetite loss in remission induction chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia--a randomized comparative trial between granisetron alone and granisetron plus methylprednisolone].

The prevention of nausea, vomiting and appetite loss induced by remission induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia was compared by randomization between granisetron alone and combination with granisetron plus methylprednisolone. Granisetron was administered at 40 micrograms/kg during chemotherapy, and methylprednisolone was administered concomitantly at 125 mg/body for 3 days or more in the combination group. The single and combination groups comprised 14 and 13 patients, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the background of both groups. To evaluate the effect they were scored according to 4 grades, and evaluated every 24 hours from the start of chemotherapy to 5 days after its completion. The complete inhibition rate of vomiting was as high as 71.4% and 92.3% in the single and combination groups, respectively, showing no significant difference. The grade of vomiting was mild in both groups. Nausea was noted in 71.4% and 46.2%, respectively, and the inhibitory effect tended to be higher in the combination group. Appetite loss developed in 92.9% and 41.7%, respectively, and the prevention effect was clearly higher in the combination group. The prevention effects on nausea 7, 8 and 10 days after the start of chemotherapy, on appetite loss 2-10 days after it, and 2-5 days after its completion, were higher in the combination group. Granisetron revealed an excellent inhibitory effect on vomiting induced by remission induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, but combination with granisetron and methylprednisolone was considered useful for nausea in the latter half of the treatment period and for appetite loss during the whole period.
