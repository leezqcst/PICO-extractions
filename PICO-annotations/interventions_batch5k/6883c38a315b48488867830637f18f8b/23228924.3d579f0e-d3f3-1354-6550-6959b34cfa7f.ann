T1	Intervention 130 847	We aimed to determine whether the myocardial extracellular volume (ECV), measured using T1 measurements obtained during cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were increased in patients treated with anthracyclines. We performed cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography and measured the ECV in 42 patients treated with anthracyclines. The data from the cardiac magnetic resonance study were compared to those from healthy volunteers. The anthracycline-treated cohort consisted of 21 men and 21 women with a mean age of 55 ± 17 years, who presented a median of 84 months after chemotherapy with a cumulative anthracycline exposure of 282 ± 65 mg/m(2) and a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 52 ± 12%
