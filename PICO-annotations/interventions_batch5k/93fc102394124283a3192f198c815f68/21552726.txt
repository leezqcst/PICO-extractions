Comparison of the evolutional process of children with autism spectrum disorders in different language therapeutic interventions.

PURPOSE To analyze and compare the extension and the speed of the evolutional process of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders in direct and indirect interventions as opposed to only indirect intervention.
METHODS The design of this study is a clinical trial. The sample was composed of 11 children diagnosed with Autism (n=6) and Asperger syndrome (n=5) by a multidisciplinary team, that attended specialized speech-language pathology therapy at the institution were the study was carried out. These children were randomly divided into two groups: Therapy Group (TG) - composed by six subjects receiving both direct and indirect intervention; and Orientation Group (OG) - constituted by five subjects receiving exclusively indirect intervention. It was used the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) to interview the mothers, and the Sample of Vocal Behavior (SVB), in three occasions: at the beginning of the intervention process (time 0), six months later (time 1) and 12 months later (time 2).
RESULTS It was observed greater speed and extension in the evolutional process of the TG Group, both in the analysis of the Autism Behavior Checklist (total and partial scores) and the Sample of Vocal Behavior, especially in the item Full Language. The performance of children with Asperger syndrome was considered more positive when compared to that of children with autism. There was greater evolution in younger children and with normal, mild, and moderate adaptive functioning.
CONCLUSION The tendency towards better performance of the children attending direct and indirect intervention showed that this association is fundamental in the therapeutic process of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.
