[Comparative effects of nebivolol and valsartan on atrial electromechanical coupling in newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertensive patients].

OBJECTIVES Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Increased atrial electromechanical coupling time interval measured by tissue Doppler is accepted as an important factor for prediction of AF development in hypertensive patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, and nebivolol, a beta-blocker, on atrial electromechanical coupling in newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertensive patients.
STUDY DESIGN The study included 60 newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertensive patients with no other systemic disease. The patients were randomized to receive nebivolol 5 mg (30 patients; 21 women, 9 men; mean age 48.4 ± 11.4 years) and valsartan 160 mg (30 patients; 21 women, 9 men; mean age 49.8 ± 11.3 years). All the patients underwent tissue Doppler echocardiographic examination before and three months after treatment to compare the effects of the two drugs on atrial electromechanical coupling.
RESULTS Baseline blood pressures, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, and atrial electromechanical coupling were similar in both groups (p>0.05). Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure after treatment, with similar efficacy (p>0.05). Atrial electromechanical coupling time intervals showed significant decreases in both groups.
CONCLUSION Prolonged interatrial electromechanical time intervals in hypertensives are improved with antihypertensive treatment.
