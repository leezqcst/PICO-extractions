Cyclosporin A increases somatomedin C insulin-like growth factor I levels in chronic rheumatic diseases.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether anabolic hormones that affect the musculoskeletal system and active on the immune cells changed during cyclosporin A (CysA) therapy.
METHODS We carried out a randomized study of patients with rheumatic disease attending the outpatient clinic for rheumatic diseases. Twenty-four patients with chronic arthritis [20 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 4 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA)] were divided into 2 groups (10 RA, 2 PsA) and randomly given CysA 5 mg/kg daily or hydroxychloroquine (OH-Chlor) 6 mg/kg daily in divided doses.
RESULTS A significant increase of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (somatomedin C) levels and of bone Gla protein was shown after 2 months in the CysA treated group, but not in the OH-Chlor group. A statistically significant correlation was observed between changes of IGF-I levels and of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS). This finding was confirmed in a further series of 39 patients. No changes were seen in 25 OH-D, 1-25(OH)2-D3 or parathyroid hormone after CysA.
CONCLUSION The effects of CysA on IGF-I may explain some of the clinical, immunologic, and metabolic results during CysA treatment of rheumatic diseases.
