Science to practice in underserved communities: the effectiveness of school mental health programming.

This study examined the effectiveness of a treatment program comprised of several components based on evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for disruptive behavior problems delivered to youth participating in a school mental health program in an underserved community in the Appalachian region. Participants were 117 children in kindergarten through 6th grade including 91 children (78% male) from 5 schools who were consecutively referred to the intervention program and 26 children (73% male) from 3 schools in which program implementation was delayed for 1 year. Treatment outcome was measured via parent and teacher ratings of child symptoms and functioning. The treatment condition resulted in significant reduction in hyperactivity/impulsivity and early aggressive and delinquent behavior, as well as significant improvement in several other functional domains. Results suggest that EBTs can retain their effectiveness when transported to a community context.
