Enhanced small group instruction using choral responding and student interaction for children with autism and developmental disabilities.

The use of effective instructional strategies in small groups was investigated to determine learning effects for 24 elementary age students with autism and developmental disabilities. Effective strategies included (a) the use of choral responding; (b) the use of student-to-student responding; (c) the rotation of materials every 5 minutes during the 30-minute group while teaching 2 to 3 concepts; and (d) the use of random, unpredictable trials for student responding. Thirty-minute language groups were targeted to teach receptive and expressive skills using pictures and common objects across five categories (e.g., household items, foods). Results showed increased opportunities to respond, increased levels of responding and academic engagement, higher gains on weekly criterion-referenced pre- and posttests, and decreased passive and inappropriate student behavior during interventions.
