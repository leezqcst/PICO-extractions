A comparative trial of fixed ratio beta-adrenoceptor blocker and diuretic combination products in moderate hypertension.

Two fixed ratio combination tablets, 10 mg pindolol combined with 5 mg clopamide and 100 mg metoprolol combined with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, were compared at two dose levels in a double-blind crossover trial in 10 previously untreated hypertensive patients. No significant difference was observed between resting blood pressure on the two combinations at either dose level. Exercise systolic pressure was lower after the pindolol/clopamide combination at low dose (p less than 0.05). The incidence of side-effects in this trial was high but proper comparison of the two products could not be made because of the small number of patients. It is suggested that combination products should be used only after patients have failed to respond adequately to a single agent.
