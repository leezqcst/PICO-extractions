Pentoxifylline to treat radiation proctitis: a small and inconclusive randomised trial.

This prospective randomised controlled study of 40 patients could not show a statistically significant advantage with 6 months of pentoxifylline compared with standard measures for late radiation-induced rectal bleeding. However, a modest benefit cannot be excluded and larger randomised placebo-controlled trials with longer durations of pentoxifylline treatment may be justified.
