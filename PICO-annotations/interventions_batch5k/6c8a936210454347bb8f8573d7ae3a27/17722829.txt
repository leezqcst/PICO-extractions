[Effect of acupuncture on rehabilitation training of child's autism].

OBJECTIVE To observe the effect of acupuncture on rehabilitation training for children's autism.
METHODS Forty autistic children receiving rehabilitation training were divided into a control group and a treatment group, 20 cases in each group. The control group received rehabilitation training including ABA training, the Conductive Education Approach and the training of sensory integration, about 90 sessions for each training; the treatment group received acupuncture treatment for 60-90 sessions after the rehabilitation training. Their results were detected by the revised Chinese version of Psycho-Educational Profile for autistic and developmentally disabled children (C-PEP).
RESULTS The markedly effective rate was 55.0% in the treatment group and 15.0% in the control group with a very significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01); the differences before and after training in some projects such as the total score of development, imitation, oral cognition in the treatment group were very significantly different from those in the control group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION Acupuncture combined with scientific and effective rehabilitation training has a better therapeutic effect than that of the simple rehabilitation training for child's autism.
