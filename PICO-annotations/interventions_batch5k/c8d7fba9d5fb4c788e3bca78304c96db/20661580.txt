A comparison of the effect of short-term aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) and GnRH agonist (triptorelin) versus case control on pregnancy rate and symptom and sign recurrence after laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis.

PURPOSE To compare the role of an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) with a GnRH agonist (triptorelin) versus case control on the pregnancy rate and recurrence of symptoms and signs in patients with endometriosis.
METHODS In a prospective randomized clinical trial, after treatment of 144 infertile women in their reproductive age by laparoscopy (whose endometriosis was confirmed by prior laparoscopy), they were divided into 3 groups: group 1 (47 cases) who received letrozole for 2 months, group 2 (40 patients) who were prescribed triptorelin for 2 months and group 3 who were 57 patients in the control group and did not receive any medication. We followed up each group at least for 12 months after their restoration of regular cycle.
RESULTS Pregnancy rate was 23.4% in group 1, 27.5% in group 2, and 28.1% in group 3. The results did not show significant differences among the 3 groups. Recurrence rate of endometriosis was 6.4% in group 1, 5% group 2 and 5.3% in group 3, which was not statistically significantly different as well.
CONCLUSION Pregnancy rate and endometriosis recurrence rate are comparable among the 3 groups.
