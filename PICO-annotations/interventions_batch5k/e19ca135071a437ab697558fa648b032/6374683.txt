A comparison of an aqueous and a pressurized nasal spray of beclomethasone dipropionate in the management of seasonal rhinitis.

A multi-centre, double-blind, parallel group study was carried out in 38 patients with seasonal rhinitis to compare a new aqueous nasal spray of beclomethasone dipropionate with the conventional pressurized nasal spray. Beclomethasone dipropionate (200 micrograms) was administered twice daily for a treatment period of 2 weeks. Both treatments were found to be equally effective and well tolerated. It is suggested, therefore, that the new aqueous nasal spray provides an alternative method of intranasal administration of the steroid for patients who may prefer an aqueous product.
