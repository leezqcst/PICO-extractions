Paracervical anesthesia for outpatient hysteroscopy.

One hundred seventy-seven women aged 41 +/- 8 (mean +/- SD) years, referred for evaluation of excessive uterine bleeding, were enrolled in an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of local anesthesia before hysteroscopy in an outpatient population. The patients underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy with paracervical block by 10 mL of 1% mepivacaine hydrochloride solution (n = 87) or no local anesthesia (n = 90) and assessed lower abdominal and pelvic pain according to a 10-point linear analog scale. The mean +/- SD pain score was 4.5 +/- 2.0 at hysteroscopy and 5.2 +/- 2.1 at endometrial biopsy in the 87 subjects given a paracervical block versus 4.9 +/- 2.2 and 5.7 +/- 2.4 in the 90 women not given local anesthesia, without statistically significant differences. Paracervical anesthesia for routine outpatient hysteroscopy in premenopausal women may be superfluous.
