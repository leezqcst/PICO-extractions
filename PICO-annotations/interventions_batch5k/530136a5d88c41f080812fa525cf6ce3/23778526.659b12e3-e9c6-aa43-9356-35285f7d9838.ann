T1	Intervention 200 380	examined the prognostic value of inflammatory markers (albumin, white-cell count and its components, and platelets) in pre-treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
T2	Intervention 426 635	multivariable proportional hazards models were generated to examine the impact of inflammatory markers and established prognostic factors (performance status, calcium, and haemoglobin) on overall survival (OS)
T3	Intervention 637 744	We evaluated a new prognostic classification incorporating additional information from inflammatory markers
