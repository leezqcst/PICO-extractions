T1	Intervention 1 124	Effect of branch chain amino acid enriched formula on postoperative fatigue and nutritional status after digestive surgery]
T2	Intervention 137 290	To evaluate the effect of branch chain amino acid (BCAA) enriched formula on nutritional status and postoperative fatigue for digestive surgery patients.
T3	Intervention 299 313	Forty patients
T4	Intervention 692 835	The cumulative postoperative fatigue scores were lower in BCAA group than that in the control group at the 4th, 5th and 7th day after operation
T5	Intervention 1408 1544	TPN with BCAA enriched formula can reduce postoperative fatigue score and improve the nutritional status for digestive surgery patients.
T6	Intervention 1062 1172	no significant difference in elevation of serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin at the 7th day
T7	Intervention 508 683	Nitrogen balance,serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, retinol binding protein and postoperative fatigue score were monitored during the postoperative period.
