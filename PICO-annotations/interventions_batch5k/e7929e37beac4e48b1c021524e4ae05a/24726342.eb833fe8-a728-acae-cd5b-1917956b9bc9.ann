T1	Intervention 0 107	Assessment of acute bronchodilator effects from specific airway resistance changes in stable COPD patients.
T2	Intervention 123 136	COPD patients
T3	Intervention 195 266	forced expiratory volume at 1s (ΔFEV1) and forced vital capacity (ΔFVC)
T4	Intervention 565 573	two days
T5	Intervention 575 591	60 COPD patients
T6	Intervention 748 843	Spirographic and ΔsRAW-based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients, respectively
T7	Intervention 1241 1470	In assessing the acute functional effect of bronchodilators, ΔsRAW-based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC-based criteria, being more closely related to bronchodilator-induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest.
