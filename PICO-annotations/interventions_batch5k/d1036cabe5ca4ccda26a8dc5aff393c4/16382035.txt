Albendazole trial at 15 or 30 mg/kg/day for subarachnoid and intraventricular cysticercosis.

Thirty-six patients with subarachnoid and intraventricular cysticercosis were randomly assigned to receive albendazole at 15 or 30 mg/kg/day plus dexamethasone for 8 days. Results favored a higher dose, with larger cyst reduction on MRI at 90 and 180 days and higher albendazole sulfoxide levels in plasma. An albendazole course at 30 mg/kg/day combined with corticosteroids is safe and more effective than the usual dose. A single treatment was insufficient in intraventricular and giant cysts.
