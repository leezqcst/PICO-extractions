Antifibrinolytic therapy for prevention of hemorrhage during surgery of the thyroid gland.

The amount of fibrinolytic activity in the thyroid gland equals that of the prostate. In order to examine the effect of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexemic acid on perioperative bleeding saline or tranexemic acid were given randomized double blind to 76 consecutive patients who came for scheduled thyroid surgery. No significant differences were found in perioperative bleeding between patients in the treatment group (n = 39) and control group (n = 37).
