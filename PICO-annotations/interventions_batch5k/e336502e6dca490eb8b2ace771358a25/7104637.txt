Intraoperative microscopy of bile--is it useful?

Direct microscopy of the bile was performed during cholecystectomy in 111 patients in an attempt to identify those with a high risk of wound infection. Bacteria were identified in 23 patients, 11 of 83 undergoing cholecystectomy alone and 12 of 28 undergoing exploration of the common bile duct (P less than 0.01). These 23 patients were randomly allocated to an antibiotic group or a control group; there was one wound infection in the antibiotic group and two in the control group. A total of 14 patients developed wound sepsis. Infection was more likely if the common bile duct was explored (6 of 28) rather than cholecystectomy alone (8 of 83). There was a poor correlation between microscopy and culture of the bile for bacteria and there was no increase in sepsis when bacteria were observed on microscopy. We were not able to identify a high risk group of patients by intraoperative microscopy of bile.
