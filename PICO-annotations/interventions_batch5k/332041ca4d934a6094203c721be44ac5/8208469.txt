[Perioperative teicoplanin prophylaxis in patients undergoing breast reconstruction with the abdominal wall. A case-control study].

The authors report the results of a randomized clinical trial of antibiotic prophylaxis of postoperative infection following breast reconstruction by transposition of rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAMF). The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a short-term parenteral prophylaxis with Teicoplanin and the end-point of the study was the evaluation of wound contamination assessed by means of microbiologic culture of drainage fluid. From October 1990 to March 1992 38 patients were recruited: 20 patients in the antibiotic prophylaxis arm and 18 patients in the control group. Analysis of drainage fluids showed a higher contamination rate (15/18 = 83%) in the control group as compared to the prophylaxis arm (2/20 = 10%) (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 11 patients in the control arm suffered from fever > 37.5 degrees C for at least 3 days as compared to 1 patient in the antibiotic prophylaxis group; the postoperative stay was 13.3 +/- 4.3 and 9.0 +/- 1.6 in the control and antibiotic arm respectively. No antibiotic related side effects were evidenced through the study. These results seem to confirm the value of parenteral short-term antibiotic prophylaxis of postoperative infection in such kind of "clean" operative procedure.
