Maximal bioavailability of digoxin from tablets and oral solution in steady state.

Comparison has been made between the absorption of digoxin from Lanoxin tablets and the absorption of international chemical reference substance digoxin from an oral solution. Plasma levels, areas under 24-hour plasma concentration curves and urinary excretion were similar by both formulations in steady state. 78% of the digoxin administered was absorbed from the tablets and 76% from the solution. Rapid dissolution in the intestinal fluids accounts for the high digoxin bioavailability of the tablets.
