Roles of adapalene in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor.

BACKGROUND Ketoconazole is a typical treatment available for pityriasis versicolor; tretinoin cream is effective, too. Adapalene gel is a tretinoin derivative and has a lower incidence of irritation compared with other topical retinoid products. However, there are no reports on adapalene gel for the treatment of pityriasis versicolor.
OBJECTIVE To study the effect of adapalene gel comparing the treatment with adapalene gel and 2% ketoconazole cream in pityriasis versicolor.
METHODS Eighty patients suffering from pityriasis versicolor were randomly divided into two groups; one group were treated with 2% ketoconazole cream topically twice daily for 2 weeks, adapalene gel was used for the other group in a similar fashion.
RESULTS There were no significant differences in efficacy between the two groups. No major side effects were noted in any of the groups either.
CONCLUSION Adapalene was the favorable option in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor. The probable therapeutic mechanism of adapalene is also discussed.
