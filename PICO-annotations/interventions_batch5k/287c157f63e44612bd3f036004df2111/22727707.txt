Rosiglitazone and cognitive function in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a pilot study.

Studies have shown that insulin resistance is associated with cognitive impairment. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonists improve insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosiglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist, on cognition in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. In an eight-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial, clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia were randomized to receive rosiglitazone (4mg/day) or placebo. A neuropsychological battery including the Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the verbal fluency test, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), the Trail-Making Test (TMT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was administered at baseline and week eight. Nineteen patients completed the study. There were no significant differences on any demographic or general clinical variables between the rosiglitazone group (n=9) and the placebo group (n=10). When baseline scores were controlled, there were no significant differences in change scores of cognitive performance over eight weeks between the two groups. In this pilot study, rosiglitazone had no cognitive benefit in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. Future studies with longer treatment duration and larger sample size are needed to further explore the potential role of rosiglitazone in improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.
