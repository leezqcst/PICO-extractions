T1	Intervention 662 1045	Women randomised to the study group (scan group) underwent an ultrasound dating scan between 8 and 12 weeks, measuring crown-rump length. The estimated date of delivery (EDD) was changed if there was a discrepancy of more than 5 days from the gestation, calculated from the last menstrual period (LMP). For the remaining women (no-scan group), gestation was determined using the LMP.
