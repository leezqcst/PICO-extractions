T1	Intervention 321 966	In the first study 388 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to treatment with propranolol, atenolol, or placebo, and when analysed on an initial intention to treat basis there was no significant difference between the three groups in respect of the mortality at one year. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that either atenolol, or propranolol reduced the incidence of 'serious' ventricular arrhythmias in the coronary care unit. In the second study 473 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to treatment with oxprenolol, disopyramide phosphate, or placebo.
