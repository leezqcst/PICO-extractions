Effects of a low-salt diet and of acute salt loading on blood pressure and intralymphocytic sodium concentration in young subjects with borderline hypertension.

1. Three groups of young patients with borderline hypertension were studied for a 12 months period. The first was on a free sodium diet while the second was on a low-salt diet. The third group of patients underwent acute salt loading. 2. After 12 months the group on free diet showed a significant increase of intralymphocytic sodium but no change in blood pressure was noted. Five patients who were re-checked after 24 months also had a significant increase in blood pressure. 3. Patients treated with a low-salt diet showed a significant decrease of both intralymphocytic sodium concentration and blood pressure. 4. After acute salt loading, borderline subjects with high intralymphocytic sodium showed a significant greater natriuresis whereas intralymphocytic sodium increased only in those subjects in whom it was initially normal.
