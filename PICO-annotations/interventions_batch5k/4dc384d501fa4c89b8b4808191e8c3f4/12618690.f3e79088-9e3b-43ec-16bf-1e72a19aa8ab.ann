T1	Intervention 669 1416	METHODS This is a cooperative, multicenter, retrospective review of 832 patients stratified by CEAP classification. The series consisted of 300 patients with C4 CVI, 119 patients with C5 CVI, and 413 patients with C6 CVI. A subset of 92 patients with C4 disease were prospectively randomized, and ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) was determined preoperatively and postoperatively. All patients underwent duplex US scanning to document reflux in the deep, superficial, and perforating venous systems. Efficacy, safety, and durability were evaluated over follow-up of 1 to 9 years (mean, 31/2 years). Uniformity was attempted by adoption of the senior author's protocol and technique through on-site preceptorship in each surgeon's operative theater
