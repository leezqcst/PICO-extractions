The effect of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination on blood pressure and on the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensive subjects.

The pharmacodynamic effects and acceptability of perindopril (4 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg daily) given alone or in combination for 1 month were investigated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study. The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and its active metabolite perindoprilat and the time course of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition were studied for 72 h following the last dose of treatment in the two appropriate groups. Similar decreases in blood pressure were seen 24 h after the last dose of perindopril or hydrochlorothiazide (11/7 mm Hg supine) given alone at these doses. The effect of these drugs given together was additive on diastolic blood pressure and synergistic on systolic blood pressure (24.5/12.6 mm Hg supine) taking into account the placebo response. The significant increase in plasma renin activity produced by perindopril alone was potentiated by concurrent administration of hydrochlorothiazide. The formation of perindoprilat was slightly reduced in the group also receiving hydrochlorothiazide and there was a very small reduction in ACE inhibition in this group. Perindopril, whether given alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, was well tolerated and produced no clinically significant change in routine haematology or serum biochemistry. The additive or synergistic effects of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide on blood pressure must be due to their complementary physiological actions and not to a pharmacokinetic interaction.
