T1	Intervention 789 1123	measured the concentration of extracellular glycerol (EGC) in adipose tissue in response to (1) pharmacologic stimulation with isoprenaline (1 and 10 micromol/L) in situ, (2) stimulation with intravenous infusion of epinephrine (0.0375 microg/min/kg body weight), and (3) submaximal aerobic exercise (50% V*O2max, 60-minute duration).
T2	Intervention 444 689	fed, in random order, with a high-fat diet (HFD) (65% of energy content fat, 15% protein, 20% carbohydrate) or a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) (70% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 15% fat) for 5 days, with a washout period of 10 days between the diets
