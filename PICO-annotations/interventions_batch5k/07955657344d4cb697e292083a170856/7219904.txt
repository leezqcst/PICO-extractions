The effects of prophylactic management and therapeutics on hypertensive disease in pregnancy: preliminary studies.

A controlled prospective evaluation of pregnancy complicated by chronic hypertension is proposed and preliminary data on population selection and pregnancy outcome are presented. Sixty-three women with evidence of underlying hypertensive disease were followed prospectively throughout pregnancy. Twenty-three patients were followed in a protocol of intensified prenatal care and randomized assignment of antihypertensive agents: placebo, hydralazine, or methyldopa. Forty patients were followed in the high-risk pregnancy clinics at Duke University. The incidence of preeclampsia in the randomized prophylactic antihypertensive group was statistically lower than that in the nonrandomized group (8.7 versus 32.5%; P less than .01). There were no other statistically significant differences between the groups. The 63 hypertensive women had a high incidence of diabetes mellitus diagnosed during pregnancy (49.2%) as compared to the authors' general obstetric population (8.1%).
