Management of the thyroid isthmus in tracheostomy: a prospective and retrospective study.

The thyroid isthmus is often encountered while a tracheostomy is being performed. This study details retrospective and prospective comparison of electrocautery division of the isthmus with older techniques. In this study, electrocautery division of the thyroid isthmus during tracheostomy is faster and as safe as other techniques with respect to blood loss, perioperative complications, and airway outcome.
