Efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate use in the prevention of perirectal infections in patients with acute leukemia.

The frequency of rectal infections is increased in patients with acute leukemia. Complications associated with rectal lesions may be severe enough to cause life-threatening septicemia. Clinical research evaluating the effects of preventive perirectal skin care is scarce. This study's purpose was to determine whether using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in a prophylactic perirectal skin-care regimen decreases perirectal infections and whether it produces more skin irritation than a nonmedicated skin cleanser. The sample consisted of 40 patients, 16 of whom were randomized to use chlorhexidine and 24 of whom were randomized to use nonmedicated skin cleanser. Chi-square and t-tests were used to analyze the incidence of skin breakdown and rectal infections; the correlation between the two factors; a positive history of rectal infections, fissures, or hemorrhoids; presence of hemorrhoids; severity of diarrhea; and duration and severity of granulocytopenia. A positive relationship was found between the severity of granulocytopenia and the incidence of rectal infections (p = 0.02). No significant difference was seen in the occurrence of perirectal infections (p = 0.35) or skin breakdown (p = 0.18) between the two groups. The data suggest that CHG does not offer increased protection against perirectal infections in patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, nor is it more irritating than a nonmedicated skin cleanser. Further studies are needed to examine the efficacy of hygienic measures such as using skin disinfectants to prevent infections in patients who are immunocompromised.
