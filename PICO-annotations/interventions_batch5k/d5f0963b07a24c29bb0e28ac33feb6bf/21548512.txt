Pulsed azithromycin treatment is as effective and safe as 2-week-longer daily doxycycline treatment of acne vulgaris: a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study.

Efficacy and safety of azithromycin and doxycycline for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris were evaluated (240 patients) in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The evaluation of clinical efficacy was based on the change in the number of facial inflammatory lesions from baseline to the end of treatment, and noninferiority was defined by the upper 95% confidence limit of the difference between two treatments being less than 9. Reduction in the number of lesions was similar with both azithromycin and doxycycline treatments (27 +/- 12 and 30 +/- 12, respectively) in both groups. Also, the upper 95% confidence limit of 5 inflammatory lesions has satisfied the noninferiority criterion. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The shorter and simpler treatment schedule of azithromycin had similar efficacy and safety as doxycycline in the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris, confirming noninferiority of azithromycin as compared with doxycycline.
