Concentrated parenteral nutrition solutions and central venous catheter complications in preterm infants.

UNLABELLED Standardised, concentrated neonatal parenteral nutrition (PN) regimens can overcome early nutritional deficits in very preterm infants. A PN regimen with increased macronutrient content (standardised, concentrated, added macronutrients parenteral (SCAMP)) has been shown to improve early head growth in a randomised controlled trial. Line complications including late onset sepsis were secondary outcomes of this study. Infants were started on standardised, concentrated PN at birth and randomised at 2-5 days to either switch to SCAMP or remain on control PN. Central venous catheter (CVC), blood culture (BC) and inflammatory marker data were collected for the 28-day intervention period. 150 infants were randomised with mean (SD) birth weight (g) of 900 (158) versus 884 (183) in SCAMP (n=74) and control (n=76) groups, respectively. There were no differences in CVC use/type or duration or in positive/negative BC with/without associated C reactive protein rise in SCAMP versus control groups. Increasing the macronutrient content of a standardised, concentrated neonatal PN regimen does not increase CVC complication rates.
