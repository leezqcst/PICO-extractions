Breast cancer screening in Sweden. The single modality approach.

Four population-based breast cancer screening projects are in progress in Sweden, three of which are randomized studies. Mammography is the only screening method. 51% of all carcinomas detected at the first screening were either in situ or invasive with a diameter of 10 mm or less. Axillary metastases were found in 16% of the patients. Sensitivity was over 90% in all projects. The ultimate aim of the randomized projects is to demonstrate the effect of screening on breast cancer mortality. It is estimated that mortality statistics will reach significant levels in 1983.,
