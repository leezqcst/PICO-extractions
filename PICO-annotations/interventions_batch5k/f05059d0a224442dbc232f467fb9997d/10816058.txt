Heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits reduce circulating complement factors and interleukin-6 in paediatric heart surgery.

Children are sensitive to the inflammatory side effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Our intention was to investigate if the biocompatibility benefits of heparin-coated CPB circuits apply to children. In 20 operations, 19 children were randomized to heparin-coated (group HC, n = 10) or standard (group C, n = 10) bypass circuits. Plasma levels of acute phase reactants, interleukins, granulocytic proteins and complement factors were measured. All were significantly elevated after CPB. Levels of complement factor C3a (851 (791-959)ng/ml [median with quartiles] in group C, 497 (476-573)ng/ml in group HC, p < 0.001), Terminal Complement Complex (114 (71-130) AU/ml in group C, 35.5 (28.9-51.4) AU/ml in group HC, p < 0.001), and interleukin-6 (570 (203-743) pg/ml in group C, 168 (111-206)pg/ml in group HC, p = 0.005), were significantly reduced in group HC. Heparin-coated CPB circuits improve the biocompatibility of CPB during heart surgery in the paediatric patient population, as reflected by significantly reduced levels of circulating complement factors and interleukin-6.
