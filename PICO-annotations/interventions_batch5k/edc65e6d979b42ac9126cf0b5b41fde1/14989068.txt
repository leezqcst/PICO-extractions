[Clinical study on dan shao tang in treating IgA nephropathy of deficiency of yin with damp-heat symptom].

OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of Dan Shao Tang(DST) in treating IgA nephropathy(IgAN) of deficiency of Yin with damp-heat symptom.
METHODS 90 patients with IgAN of deficiency of Yin with damp-heat symptom were randomly divided into two groups. 50 patients in treatment group were treated with DST and western medicine and 40 patients in control group were treated only with western medicine. The effects and changes of the indexes including renal function, hematuria, proteinuria, blood IgA before and after treatment were observed.
RESULTS After six months treatment, the general effective rate in treatment group was 70.00%, which was markedly higher than that in control group(37.50%, P < 0.01). Treatment group is obviously better than control group on decreasing hematuria, proteinuria, blood IgA and improving renal function(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION DST is effective on IgAN of deficiency of Yin with damp-heat symptom.
