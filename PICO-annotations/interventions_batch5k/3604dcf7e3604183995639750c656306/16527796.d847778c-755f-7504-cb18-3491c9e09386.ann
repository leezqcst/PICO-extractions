T1	Intervention 397 1147	Subjects comprised 131 adult patients who under-went NTI. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a) NTI under CTSC guidance (G[+] group). The CTSC (14 Fr) was first inserted through the tracheal tube, with the tip of the CTSC emerging from the distal end of the tube. The curved tip was directed ventrally. Both tracheal tube and CTSC were advanced together through the nasopharynx; b) NTI without CTSC guidance (G[-] group). The tracheal tube was advanced into the nasal cavity and passed into the pharynx without CTSC guidance. The time required to pass the endotracheal tube through the nasal cavity (nasal passage time), success rate of nasal passage with nasotracheal tube, and the incidence and severity of nasal bleeding were compared
