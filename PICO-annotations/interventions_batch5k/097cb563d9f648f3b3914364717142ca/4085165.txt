Chronic lateral humeral epicondylitis--a double-blind controlled assessment of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.

Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis. As lateral humeral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a similar chronic tendon lesion, 30 patients with both clinical and thermographic evidence of tennis elbow were randomly allocated to receive either active or inactive PEMF therapy. Treatment was continued for a minimum period of eight weeks. At this time there was no statistical difference between the two groups.
