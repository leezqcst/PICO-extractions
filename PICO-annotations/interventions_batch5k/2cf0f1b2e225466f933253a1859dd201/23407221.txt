Rifampicin plus isoniazid for the prevention of tuberculosis in an immigrant population.

OBJECTIVES To compare the tolerance, adherence and effectiveness of two approaches for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI): 6 months of isoniazid (6H) vs. 3 months of isoniazid plus rifampicin (3RH).
POPULATION Immigrants with LTBI.
METHODS Participants were enrolled in a controlled, randomised clinical trial in Barcelona, Spain, from April 2001 to April 2005. Monthly follow-up was done to assess tolerance, side effects and adherence. Effectiveness was evaluated at 5 years.
RESULTS In the 590 subjects enrolled, the rate of adherence was greater in the 3RH than in the 6H arm (72% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.001). No differences between study arms were observed with respect to hepatotoxicity or side effects. Variables associated with non-adherence were diagnosis by screening (OR 1.88, 95%CI 1.26-2.82, P = 0.001), illegal immigration status (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.01-2.15, P = 0.03), unemployment (OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.28-2.85, P = 0.0008), illiteracy (OR 1.73, 95%CI 1.04-2.88, P = 0.02), lack of family support (OR 3.7, 95%CI 2.54-5.4, P = 0.001) and the 6-month treatment regimen (OR 2.45, 95%CI 1.68-3.57, P = 0.0001). None of the patients who completed either treatment developed tuberculosis.
CONCLUSIONS The 3RH regimen facilitates adherence to LTBI treatment and offers a safe, well-tolerated and effective alternative.
