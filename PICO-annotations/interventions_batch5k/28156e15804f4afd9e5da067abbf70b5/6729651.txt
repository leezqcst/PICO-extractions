High-dose weekly fractionation radiotherapy in advanced cancer of the uterine cervix.

A trial comparing two different radiotherapy techniques and schedules in the treatment of 83 patients with advanced cancer of the uterine cervix (stage IIIB) employing external irradiation alone is described. The one technique, used routinely in this department, employed a conventional daily fractionation schedule while the other used a high-dose weekly fractionation regimen. The techniques are described. The aim of the trial was to compare the efficacy and morbidity of these two methods of treatment. Dose distribution curves in cross-section and midsagittal planes are shown and calculations or equivalent doses at various selected points using Ellis's nominal single-dose formula are tabulated. The 2-year survival figures were 33% for the daily fractionation technique and 22% for the weekly regimen. Serious late complication rates were 6% for the daily regimen and 22% for the weekly schedule. These differences are not statistically significant. Late complication rates in the weekly fractionation regimen appeared to be lower than figures quoted by other authors. Local control within the irradiated volume was better in the group treated by the daily fractionation method.
