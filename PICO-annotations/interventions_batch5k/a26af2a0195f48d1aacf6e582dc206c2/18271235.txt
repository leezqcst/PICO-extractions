[Effects of early acupuncture on motor function of the limb in the severe head injury patients].

UNLABELLED OBJECTIVE; To observe the effects of early acupuncture on motor function of the limb in the severe head injury patients.
METHODS Ninety-six patients were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 48 cases in each group. The patient in the control group were treated by routine treatment of neurosurgical operation and drug treatment (Mannitol, Citioline Sodium, Cefeazidime, etc.). While the patient in the observation group were treated by the routine treatment and acupuncture treatment 48 h(-1) week after operation in different stages with different acupoints selected when the situation was stable. The selected main points were Neiguan (PC 6), Qu-chi (LI 11), Waiguan (TE 5), Hegu (LI 4), Binao (LI 14), Jianyu (LI 15), Fengshi (GB 31), Xuehai (SP 10), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Taichong (LR 3), etc.. The limb motor function was evaluated with Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale before treatment and after 10-week treatment.
RESULTS There was a significant improvement in the FMA score in the two groups after the treatment (P < 0.01). The comparison between the two groups after the treatment showed that the improvement of FMA score in the observation group was significantly better than the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION Early acupuncture can improve the limb motor function in the severe head injury patients.
