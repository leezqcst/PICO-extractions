Resisting good news: reactions to breast cancer risk communication.

Many women overestimate their percentage risk of breast cancer, even after they have received careful estimates from health professionals. In 2 experiments with 134 young adult women, 6 variables were explored that might influence such risk perception persistence. In Study 1, each of the following explanations was unrelated to persistence: public commitment, self-consistency, and unique causal risk models. In Study 2, two individual difference measures, pessimism and differences in understanding percentages, were unrelated to risk perception persistence. However, providing a "risk anchor" based on downward social comparison processes resulted in better risk acceptance at posttest that persisted at a 2-week follow-up assessment. This article discusses why comparison anchors might be important in risk feedback situations and concludes with recommendations for professionals who wish to provide accurate risk information and have patients adopt that information.
