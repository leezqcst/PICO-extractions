Noradrenergic response to intravenous yohimbine in patients with depression and comorbidity of depression and panic.

Adrenergic response following infusions of yohimbine or normal saline was evaluated in 9 control subjects, 8 patients suffering from a major depressive episode (MDE), and 12 patients suffering from concurrent MDE and panic disorder (MDE + P). Blood was drawn at -20, 0, 5, 10, 20, 45, and 90 min following the infusions, and assayed for norepinephrine (NE) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl glycol (MHPG). Although the patient groups exhibited higher baseline NE concentrations, and a greater NE area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-90) during the yohimbine infusion, the differences were not statistically significant. Baseline NE was significantly correlated with the NE AUC0-90 in all three groups, suggesting that, although the NE system may be dysregulated in the MDE and MDE + P patients, the NE system still appears to respond somewhat predictably following a challenge, even though the actual magnitude of response may vary.
