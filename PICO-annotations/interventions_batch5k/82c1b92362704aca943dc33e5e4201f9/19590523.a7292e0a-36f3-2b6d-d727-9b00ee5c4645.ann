T1	Intervention 612 1032	Eight spots were equally distributed at a distance of 500 microm from one another over the anterior trabeculum. The SLT patients were treated with a frequency-doubled q-switched neodymium:yytrium-aluminum-garnet laser (wavelength 532 nm). Approximately 50 adjacent, but not overlapping, laser spots were distributed over 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork, using an energy level ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mJ per pulse.
