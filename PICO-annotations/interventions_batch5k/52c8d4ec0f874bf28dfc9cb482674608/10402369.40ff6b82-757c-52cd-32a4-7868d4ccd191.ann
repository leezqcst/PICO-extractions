T1	Intervention 0 84	Adjuvant L-arginine treatment for in-vitro fertilization in poor responder patients.
T2	Intervention 155 311	evaluate the role of L-arginine in improving uterine and follicular Doppler flow and in improving ovarian response to gonadotrophin in poor responder women.
T3	Intervention 323 367	34 patients undergoing assisted reproduction
T4	Intervention 372 647	divided in two groups according to different ovarian stimulation protocols: (i) flare-up gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) plus elevated pure follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH) (n = 17); and (ii) flare-up GnRHa plus elevated pFSH plus oral L-arginine (n = 17)
T5	Intervention 649 897	During the ovarian stimulation regimen, the patients were submitted to hormonal (oestradiol and growth hormone), ultrasonographic (follicular number and diameter, endometrial thickness) and Doppler (uterine and perifollicular arteries) evaluations.
T6	Intervention 911 1065	the plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of arginine, citrulline, nitrite/nitrate (NO2-/NO3-), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were assayed
T7	Intervention 1104 1565	In the L-arginine treated group a lower cancellation rate, an increased number of oocytes collected, and embryos transferred were observed. In the same group, increased plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of arginine, citrulline, NO2-/NO3-, and IGF-1 was observed. Significant Doppler flow improvement was obtained in the L-arginine supplemented group. Three pregnancies were registered in these patients. No pregnancies were observed in the other group.
