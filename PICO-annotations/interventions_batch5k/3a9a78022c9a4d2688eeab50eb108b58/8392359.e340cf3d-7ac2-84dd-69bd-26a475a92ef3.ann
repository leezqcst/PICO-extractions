T1	Intervention 85 538	We studied 40 children younger than 4 yr having elective abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia supplemented with either systemic opioids or extradural bupivacaine. Venous blood samples were obtained before tracheal intubation to measure baseline concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, glucose, ACTH and cortisol. Additional samples were obtained 45 min after the start of surgery, at the end of surgery, 1 h and 24 h after the end of surgery
