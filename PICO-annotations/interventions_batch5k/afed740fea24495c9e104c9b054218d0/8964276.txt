A randomised open multicentre comparative trial of lamotrigine and carbamazepine as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent epilepsy.

The efficacy and safety of lamotrigine and carbamazepine as monotherapy in patients with untreated, newly diagnosed or recurrent partial and/or generalised tonic-clonic seizures, were compared in a randomised, open, multicentre study. Patients received 24 weeks' treatment with oral lamotrigine 100 mg (LTG 100, n = 115) or 200 mg (LTG 200, n = 111) or carbamazepine 600 mg (CBZ 600, n = 117). Efficacy measurements were comparable between the three treatment groups, although the higher lamotrigine dose was possibly most effective, with 60.4% completing seizure free compared with 51.3% (LTG 100) and 54.7% (CBZ 600). Both dosage regimens of lamotrigine were well tolerated. More patients on CBZ 600 reported adverse experiences, 66% versus 53% (LTG 100) and 58% (LTG 200), and of these a greater proportion were attributed to CBZ 600 treatment, 53% versus 23% (LTG 100) and 28% (LTG 200). Similarly, a greater proportion of the CBZ 600 group required a change in dose, 47% versus 20% (LTG 100) and 17% (LTG 200) or withdrew completely due to adverse experiences, 10.3% versus 4.3% (LTG 100) and 4.5% (LTG 200). The most common adverse experience leading to withdrawal was rash, with approximately double the proportion of reports occurring in patients on CBZ 600 (5.1%) compared with lamotrigine (1.7% on LTG 100 and 2.7% on LTG 200). Overall lamotrigine appeared equally effective but better tolerated compared with carbamazepine.
