Variability of thrombolytic coronary reperfusion: an angiographic study of streptokinase and anistreplase.

A total of 1,615 angiographic readings in 240 patients with acute myocardial infarction were analyzed from a randomized trial of intravenous anistreplase (Eminase), also known as anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), versus intracoronary streptokinase. Coronary arteriography was performed at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after drug infusion. Coronary flow in the infarct-related artery was defined using the TIMI criteria. Some serial change in perfusion was noted in 25% of the total patient population and in 49% of all reperfusion patients. Complete loss of perfusion (grade 2 or 3 to grade 0 or 1) occurred in 35% of all reperfused patients. Half of these patients ultimately developed complete loss of perfusion at the study endpoint. All of these changes in flow were statistically more common for the circumflex coronary artery and early treatment (less than 4 h), but did not differ for anistreplase or streptokinase. We conclude that frequent alterations in coronary blood flow occur early during reperfusion therapy and that these findings may explain reports with varying results of thrombolytic therapy. Any angiographic assessment of thrombolytic drug efficacy should take these variations as well as interobserver variability into account.
