Use and limitations of Holter electrocardiography in assessing drug therapy of myocardial ischemia during the peri-PTCA period.

Incidence and pattern of myocardial ischemia during the peri-PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) period and the possible role of continuous intravenous isosorbide dinitrate in its prevention were examined prospectively in 30 patients. Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was performed for 21 +/- 3 h before PTCA and continued during and for 41 +/- 8 h after the procedure. Before PTCA, 19 ischemic episodes were present in 10 (33%) of 30 patients. PTCA produced an abrupt decrease in number (p = 0.015) and duration (p = 0.03) of spontaneous ischemic episodes. The rarity of recurrent myocardial ischemic events by Holter monitoring after PTCA negated any attempt at assessing the efficacy of intravenous isosorbide dinitrate in their prevention. Holter monitoring could not be used as an early predictor of late coronary restenosis.
