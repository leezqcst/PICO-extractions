Evaluation of apical sealing ability and adaptation to dentine of two resin-based sealers.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the apical sealing ability and adaptation to dentine of two resin-based root canal sealers. The root canals of 55 human maxillary anterior teeth were prepared using a step-back technique and the smear layer removed with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The teeth were divided into two groups of 25 teeth and the remaining five teeth served as control. Then the teeth were prepared and obturated with gutta-percha by a lateral condensation and either AH plus and EndoRez used as a sealer. Twenty teeth from each group were used for the apical leakage test and the remaining five teeth from each group were used for examination under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). For apical leakage test, teeth were covered with nail varnish and sticky wax to within 1 mm of the apical foramen and placed in 2% methylene blue for 7 days. After this period, the teeth were sectioned longitudinally and apical leakage measurements made. The mean value of dye penetration for AH plus was 2.87 +/- 0.43 mm, while that of EndoRez was 4.54 +/- 0.36 mm. The difference between mean of dye penetration was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The SEM examination showed both sealers had better adaptation and penetration in coronal and middle thirds than apical third of root canal. In apical third, AH plus was adapted better adpated to dentine than EndoRez. In conclusion, AH plus sealer has better apical sealing ability and adaptation to dentine than EndoRez sealer.
