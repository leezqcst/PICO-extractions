Effect of flurbiprofen sodium on pupillary dilatation during scleral buckling surgery.

Maintenance of pupillary dilatation is necessary for success of scleral buckling procedures. The efficacy of 0.03% flurbiprofen in preventing intraoperative miosis was evaluated by a prospective randomized, double-masked controlled trial of 60 patients. Thirty patients received 0.03% flurbiprofen 6 times at 15 minute intervals 90 minutes preoperatively in addition to the routine dilation regimen. The treated group had a mean pupillary decrease of 1.88 mm and the control group had a decrease of 1.57 mm (p > 0.05). Flurbiprofen did not affect the pupillary size at any step of the surgery. Factors such as age of the patient, lens status, number of cryo applications, duration of surgery, and the size and extent of buckle were assessed. The use of flurbiprofen did not affect the mean pupillary change for any of these groups. Preoperative use of flurbiprofen does not significantly decrease intraoperative miosis during scleral buckling procedures.
