Study design and rationale of a dose-ranging trial of LX4211, a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2, in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.

Sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 (SGLT1) and 2 (SGLT2) are the major cellular transporters responsible for gastrointestinal (GI) glucose absorption and renal glucose reabsorption, respectively. LX4211, a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2, reduces glucose absorption from the GI tract and enhances urinary glucose excretion. Although several SGLT2-selective inhibitors have been tested in large phase 2 studies, dual inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2 is novel at this stage of drug development, and it has implications for clinical-trial design. In this article, we describe the design and rationale of a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LX4211 in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary endpoint is the change in glycated hemoglobin A1c from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of subjects achieving a glycated hemoglobin A1c value of <7%, change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose (as part of an oral glucose tolerance test), body weight, and blood pressure. Safety is evaluated with particular focus on hypoglycemia, GI symptoms, and incidence of genitourinary tract infections.
