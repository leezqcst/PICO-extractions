Recurrence of condylomata acuminata following cryotherapy is not prevented by systemically administered interferon.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether interferon alpha-2a, when utilised as adjuvant chemotherapy following ablation of condylomata acuminata (genital warts) by cryotherapy, is effective in the prevention of recurrences.
DESIGN Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Statistical analysis was by 2-tailed Fisher's Exact Test.
PATIENTS 97 patients with recurrent condylomata acuminata.
INTERVENTION 49 patients were treated with cryotherapy plus subcutaneously administered interferon alpha-2a, and 48 received cryotherapy plus placebo. Of these, 36 and 37 patients, respectively, completed the study and were evaluable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Clinical eradication of condylomata for six months following adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS By completion of the adjuvant chemotherapy, 10 (28%) interferon recipients and 16 (43%) placebo recipients experienced recurrences. At six months follow-up, 25 (69%) interferon and 27 (73%) placebo recipients experienced recurrences. In the six months following interferon therapy, only 31% of interferon and 27% of placebo recipients remained free of recurrences (p = 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS Interferon alpha-2a administered subcutaneously offers no benefit as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant to cryotherapy when used alone in the therapy of genital warts in this population of patients with recurrent condylomata.
