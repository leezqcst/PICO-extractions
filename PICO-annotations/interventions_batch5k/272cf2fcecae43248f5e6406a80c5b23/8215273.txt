Cefprozil versus penicillin V in treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.

In a randomized multicenter study, the efficacy and safety of cefprozil were compared with those of penicillin in the treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children. Of the 409 patients enrolled, 323 were evaluable for their clinical and bacteriological responses; of these 323 children, 172 received cefprozil and 151 received penicillin V. The clinical responses in patients treated with cefprozil were significantly better than those in patients who received penicillin (95.3 versus 88.1%; P = 0.023). Eradication of the original serotype of group A streptococci was achieved in 91.3% of patients treated with cefprozil and 87.4% of patients treated with penicillin, the difference not being statistically significant (P = 0.125). However, there were significantly more symptomatic patients among the bacteriological failures in the penicillin group (68.4%) than in the cefprozil group (26.7%). beta-Lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus was more frequently isolated from the throat flora during penicillin therapy than during cefprozil treatment. No difference in the incidence of adverse events probably related or of unknown relationship to the study drugs was observed in the two treatment groups (5.2% of those treated with cefprozil and 6.0% of those treated with penicillin). Cefprozil can be considered a safe and reliable drug for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis in children.
