T1	Intervention 709 1394	In this open-label, randomised controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design, we enrolled consecutive adults (age â‰¥18 years) admitted to one of 11 French intensive-care units and requiring at least one of central-venous, haemodialysis, or arterial catheters. Before catheter insertion, we randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) patients via a secure web-based random-number generator (permuted blocks of eight, stratified by centre) to have all intravascular catheters prepared with 2% chlorhexidine-70% isopropyl alcohol (chlorhexidine-alcohol) or 5% povidone iodine-69% ethanol (povidone iodine-alcohol), with or without scrubbing of the skin with detergent before antiseptic application.
