[A comparison of 2 methods of plastic cast fixation in treatment of loco classico radius fracture. A prospective, randomized study].

The purpose of this study was to compare the functional and radiological result of two different positions of the wrist in a plaster cast following Colles' fracture. For this prospective study, each of 50 patients with type A 2.2, A 3.3, C 1.2 or C 2.2 (AO classification) fractures of the radius was randomly assigned to one of two groups. Both groups were treated in the same way as far as anaesthesia and reduction were concerned. The only difference in treatment lay in the position of fixation in plaster. In group 1 the wrist was immobilized in neutral flexion-extension. In group 2 the wrist was dorsiflexed 20 degrees, while the carpus was pushed in a volar direction by an impression in the plaster cast. At review 2-7 years after the accidents, the two groups were compared with reference to symptoms, range of motion at the wrist, power of first closure and radiographic appearance. In group 1 there were 5 patients with significant disability, compared with only 1 in group 2. A significant difference was found in the range of movement between the two groups for flexion and ulnar abduction (p < 0.01). The loss of power of first clenching (difference between injured and healthy hand) was 6.2 mmHg for group 1 and 3.8 mmHg for group 2 (not significant). The radiographic examination showed significant differences both in sagittal inclination (p < 0.001) and in radial shortening (p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
