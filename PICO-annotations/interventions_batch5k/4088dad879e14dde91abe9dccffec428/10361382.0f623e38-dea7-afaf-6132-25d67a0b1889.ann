T1	Intervention 634 1625	The TSH response to TRH (25 micrograms in an intravenous bolus), serum total and free T4 and T3 levels, and 24-hour urinary-free cortisol levels were measured in 28 normal men (age 27-35 years) within 10% of their ideal body weight. They were randomly divided into 4 groups of 7. In 21 subjects (groups 1, 2, and 3), TRH tests were performed after an overnight (8 hours) fast, placebo administrations (control test), and after prolonged (56 hours) starvation. TRH tests after prolonged starvation were performed either after placebos (in all subjects) or the administration of pyridostigmine (180 mg orally) (in 7 subjects, group 1); naloxone (0.8 mg in an i.v. bolus injection) (in 7 subjects, group 2); or the combination of pyridostigmine and naloxone (in 7 subjects, group 3). The remaining 7 subjects (group 4) were tested at weekly intervals with TRH plus placebo, TRH plus naloxone, TRH plus pyridostigmine, and TRH plus naloxone plus pyridostigmine after a fasting period of 8 hours.
