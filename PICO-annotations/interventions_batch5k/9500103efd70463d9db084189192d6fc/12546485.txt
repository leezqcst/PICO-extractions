Effects of prelinguistic milieu teaching and parent responsivity education on dyads involving children with intellectual disabilities.

This study tested the effect of a method of facilitating prelinguistic communication on parents' responsivity and children's communication and productive language development. The method involved Responsivity education for the parents and Prelinguistic Milieu Teaching for the children (RPMT). Thirty-nine prelinguistic toddlers with intellectual disabilities and their primary caregivers participated in this study. Parent-child pairs were randomly assigned to either the RPMT group or a control group. Communication and language were assessed at study entry and 6, 9, and 12 months later. RPMT facilitated parental responsivity in the posttreatment period. The effect of RPMT on growth rate of child-initiated comments (i.e., the most common type of initiating joint attention) varied by pretreatment measures of that variable. The effect of RPMT on growth rate of child-initiated requests (i.e., the most common type of initiating behavior regulation) varied by presence or absence of Down syndrome. Finally, the effect of RPMT on growth of productive language varied by pretreatment frequency of canonical vocal communication. Recommended alterations in PMT and implications for defining which nonspeaking children are appropriate for prelinguistic goals and treatment were discussed.
