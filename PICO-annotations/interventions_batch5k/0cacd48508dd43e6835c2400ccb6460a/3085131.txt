Effects of mecamylamine on human cigarette smoking and subjective ratings.

Multiple measures of cigarette smoking, subjective effect and physiological effect were collected during 90-min test sessions in normal volunteers. Before sessions subjects received oral doses of mecamylamine (2.5, 5.0, 10, 20 mg) or placebo. Each dose and placebo was given three times in a randomized block sequence. Mecamylamine increased several measures of cigarette smoking, including number of cigarettes, number of puffs per cigarette, and expired air carbon monoxide level. Mecamylamine also produced modest, dose-related decreases in standing blood pressure and increases in standing heart rate. The subjective effects produced by mecamylamine were not characteristic of those of psychoactive drugs. Mecamylamine appears to have increased cigarette smoking by decreasing the effective dose level of nicotine available from cigarette smoking.
