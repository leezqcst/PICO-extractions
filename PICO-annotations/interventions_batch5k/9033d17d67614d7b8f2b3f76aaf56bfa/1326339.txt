The use of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (4-9) analog ORG 2766 in autistic children: effects on the organization of behavior.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, 14 autistic children were treated with the neuropeptide ORG 2766, a synthetic analog of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (4-9). ORG 2766 treatment (20 mg per day during 4 weeks) was associated with an increased amount and an improved quality of the social interaction of the autistic children with a familiar experimenter. These changes in interaction were clinically relevant. Following treatment with ORG 2766 gaze and smile behaviors of child and experimenter showed stronger temporal contingencies. Further, after ORG 2766, stereotypies were temporally disconnected from verbal initiatives. The data supported the notion of a stimulating effect of ORG 2766 on social interaction. The implications of these findings for the endogenous opioid theory of autism are discussed.
