[Combined preoperative xeloda and radiotherapy for lower rectal cancer].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of combined preoperative xeloda and pelvic radiotherapy on locally advanced lower rectal cancer.
METHODS Sixty lower rectal cancer patients were divided randomly into two groups. 30 patients (Group A) were treated with operation alone and 30 patients (Group B) were treated with xeloda and radiotherapy before operation.
RESULTS The operative resection, anal preservation and local recurrence rates were 86.66%, 33.33%, 15.38% in group A and 100%, 83.33%, 0% in group B (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION Combined preoperative xeloda and radiotherapy for lower rectal cancer is able to significantly improve the operative resection, anal preservation and decrease the local recurrence rates.
