Randomized prospective study to evaluate child abuse documentation in the emergency department.

OBJECTIVES The objective was to determine whether an educational intervention for health care providers would result in improved documentation of cases of possible physical child abuse in children <36 months old treated in the emergency department (ED) setting.
METHODS This study had a statewide group-randomized prospective trial design. Participating EDs were randomized to one of three intervention groups: no intervention, partial intervention, or full intervention. Medical records for children <36 months of age were abstracted before, during, and after the intervention periods for specific documentation elements. The main outcome measure was the change in documentation from baseline. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to test for intervention effect.
RESULTS A total of 1,575 charts from 14 hospitals EDs were abstracted. Hospital and demographic characteristics were similar across intervention groups. There were 922 (59%) injury visits and 653 (41%) noninjury visits. For each specific documentation element, a GEE model gave p-values of >0.2 in independent tests, indicating no evidence of significant change in documentation after the intervention. Even among the 26 charts in which the possibility of physical abuse was noted, documentation remained variable.
CONCLUSIONS The educational interventions studied did not improve ED documentation of cases of possible physical child abuse. The need for improved health care provider education in child abuse identification and documentation remains. Future innovative educational studies to improve recognition of abuse are warranted.
