Effect of esomeprazole triple therapy on eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori, gastric ulcer healing and prevention of relapse in gastric ulcer patients.

OBJECTIVES To compare esomeprazole-based triple therapy with esomeprazole alone for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), healing of ulcer and prevention of relapse in H. pylori-related gastric ulcer (GU) diseases.
METHODS In this double-blind study, 401 H. pylori-positive patients with more than or equal to two GUs were randomized to: esomeprazole (20 mg) twice daily (bid) and amoxicillin (1000 mg) bid and clarithromycin (500 mg) bid (EAC) for 1 week, followed by placebo for 3 weeks (EAC and placebo); EAC for 1 week, followed by esomeprazole (20 mg) once daily (E20) for 3 weeks (EAC and E20); or esomeprazole (20 mg) bid and placebo antimicrobials for 1 week, followed by E20 for 3 weeks (E20 bid and E20). Patients with unhealed GUs at 4 weeks received E20 for an additional 4 weeks. Healed patients were followed up for 12 months.
RESULTS Eradication rates at 4 weeks or 8 weeks were 82% for EAC and E20, 77% for EAC and placebo and 9.5% for E20 bid and E20 (intention-to-treat analysis). Significantly more patients receiving EAC than those receiving esomeprazole alone remained free of GUs during follow-up [EAC and E20, 90%; EAC and placebo, 87%; P=0.0005 for combined group vs. esomeprazole alone [E20 bid and E20 (74%)]. All treatments were well tolerated.
CONCLUSION Esomeprazole-based triple therapy is effective for the eradication of H. pylori, healing of GU and prevention of relapse. Esomeprazole monotherapy for 3 weeks after triple therapy may be beneficial in terms of healing.
