T1	Intervention 240 588	We evaluated the effects of calcitriol (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) on bone mineral density (BMD) in 76 patients (26 men and 50 women) with cirrhosis who were assigned randomly to receive calcitriol (0.5 mg twice per day) or not. The BMD of the lumbar vertebrae was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at least twice, 12-57 months apart
