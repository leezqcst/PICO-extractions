Evaluation of an interactive multi-media device for delivering information on Le Fort I osteotomy.

This study was carried out on volunteers to evaluate a newly developed interactive software package aimed at informing prospective Le Fort I osteotomy patients regarding the surgical technique and possible complications. The aim of the study was to compare two methods of information delivery; a multi-media tablet device delivering both graphic and verbal information, and an audio device delivering essentially the same information in verbal form only. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the efficiencies of the two methods. The subjects' ability to recall the information delivered by both devices was assessed using a questionnaire. The tablet device participants scored an average of 15.48 points, while the audio device participants scored an average of 268 points. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001), suggesting that the multi-media tablet device was more effective method.
