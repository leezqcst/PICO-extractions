Rehabilitation outcomes following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

This prospective study evaluated the effect of an individualized, comprehensive, home-based cardiac rehabilitation program combining exercise training with risk factor modification and psychosocial counseling on risk factors, psychological well-being, functional capacity, and work resumption in 99 post-percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) patients randomized to control (standard care plus telephone follow-up, n=49) or intervention (individualized, comprehensive, home-based cardiac rehabilitation, n=50) groups. Data were collected at time 1 (T(1)) during hospital admission, time 2 (T(2)) approximately 2 months post-PCI, and time 3 (T(3)) approximately 12 months post-PCI. Results suggest that the allocation to an individualized, comprehensive, home-based cardiac rehabilitation program provided more advantageous outcomes. At both follow-ups, the intervention group showed within-group improvement in serum cholesterol levels (P<0.02; P<0.01) and exercise participation (P<0.001; P<0.001) with differences in exercise participation favoring the intervention group (P<0.01) at T(2). Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant improvements over time in body mass index (BMI) (P<0.01), psychological well-being (P<0.001), and functional capacity (P<0.001) for both groups. More patients in the intervention group had returned to work at T(2) (P<0.001) and did so more quickly (P<0.01). These findings suggest that an individualized, comprehensive, home-based cardiac rehabilitation program improves risk factor profiles and work resumption patterns for patients following PCI.
