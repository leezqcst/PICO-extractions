Intraocular pressure changes with propofol ('Diprivan'): comparison with thiopentone.

The effects of propofol, a new non-barbiturate intravenous anaesthetic agent, on intraocular pressure (IOP) were assessed and compared with those of thiopentone. IOP was measured using an applanation tonometer for 5 min following administration of induction doses of propofol or thiopentone and inhalation of 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Both agents produced a significant fall in IOP for the period of study, by a maximum of 53% with propofol and 40% with thiopentone. Apnoea occurred with similar frequency in the two groups. Use of propofol was associated with a significant fall in arterial pressure and pain on injection in 5 out of 20 patients.
