T1	Intervention 548 688	randomized for conventional therapy (control) or continuous treatment with 10 parts per million (ppm) inhaled NO until weaning was initiated
T2	Intervention 690 772	We measured DR curves of PaO2/FIO2 versus the inhaled NO dose at regular intervals
T3	Intervention 774 893	Before treatment (Day 0), peak improvement in PaO2/FIO2 was achieved at 10 ppm for both control and NO-treated patients
T4	Intervention 895 995	After 4 days, the DR curve of the NO-treated patients was left shifted with a peak response at 1 ppm
