Effects of Combined Resistive Underwater Exercises and Interferential Current Therapy in Patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to verify the effects of combined resistive underwater exercises and interferential current on the peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstrings and pain levels in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
DESIGN This is a randomized controlled study; 30 children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis were randomly distributed into two groups: the control group (n = 15) received the traditional physical therapy program and the study group (n = 15) received resistive underwater exercises and interferential current therapy. Peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstrings and pain levels were evaluated before treatment, 1 mo later, and after 3 mos using the HUMAC NORM, CSMI Testing and Rehabilitation Isokinetic System and visual analog scale, respectively.
RESULTS In the control group, all measures showed significant differences (P < 0.05) after 1 mo except peak torque of left quadriceps and pain levels, and significant differences were found after 3 mos (P < 0.05) in all. In the study group, all measures showed significant differences after 1 and 3 mos (P < 0.05) and there were significant differences between groups after 1 and 3 mos in favor of the study group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION The combination of resistive underwater exercises and interferential current therapy is a potentially valuable treatment for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
