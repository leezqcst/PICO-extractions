T1	Intervention 166 1146	Eighty-seven children with central nervous system (CNS) leukemia were randomized to receive either induction intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) and cranial irradiation (CRT) plus maintenance ITC, or induction ITC and craniospinal irradiation (CSpRT) with no maintenance ITC. ITC consisted of six weekly injections of methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and arabinosylcytosine. Also, intensification of systemic induction and maintenance chemotherapy was given. CRT + ITC was given as CRT, 2400 rad in 12 fractions followed by ITC maintenance bimonthly for 2 years. Craniospinal irradiation consisted of CRT + 1400 rad in ten fractions to the spine. Randomization was stratified according to whether CNS leukemia occurred at initial diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (Stratum I, 15 patients), during first bone marrow (BM) remission (Stratum II, 49 patients), simultaneous with first BM relapse (Stratum III, 12 patients), or during second BM remission (Stratum IV, 11 patients).
