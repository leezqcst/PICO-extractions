T1	Intervention 108 438;439 899	The combination of vaccines and chemotherapy holds promise for cancer therapy, but the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on vaccine-induced antitumor immunity is unknown. This study was conducted to assess the effects of systemic chemotherapy on ALVAC-CEA/B7.1-induced T-cell immunity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan and were also given ALVAC-CEA/B7.1 vaccine with or without tetanus toxoid adjuvant. Eligible patients were randomized to ALVAC followed by chemotherapy and booster vaccination (group 1), ALVAC and tetanus toxoid followed by chemotherapy (group 2), or chemotherapy alone followed by ALVAC in patients without disease progression (group 3).
