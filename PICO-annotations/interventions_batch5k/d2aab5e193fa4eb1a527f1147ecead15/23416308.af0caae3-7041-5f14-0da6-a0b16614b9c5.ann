T1	Intervention 108 547;548 766	GS-9620 is a novel oral agonist of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in development for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. TLR7 is a highly conserved innate immune receptor expressed primarily on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GS-9620 in healthy volunteers. METHODS In total, 75 healthy volunteers (8 subjects in each of the 10 cohorts; 5 subjects participated in two cohorts) were randomized (6:2) to receive a single dose of GS-9620 (0.3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 12 mg) or placebo.
