Effects of irrigation fluid temperature on core body temperature during transurethral resection of the prostate.

OBJECTIVES To determine the effect irrigation fluid temperature has on core body temperature changes in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
METHODS Fifty-six male patients (mean age 71.2 +/- 8.2 years) scheduled for TURP were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 consisted of 27 patients who received room temperature irrigation fluid (70 degrees F) throughout TURP; group 2 consisted of 29 patients whose procedure was performed with warmed irrigation fluid (91.5 degrees F). The irrigation fluid used for both groups was glycine. The baseline temperature, final temperature, total time in the operating room, and amount of irrigation fluid used during the procedure were recorded for each patient.
RESULTS No significant difference in the average time spent in the operating room or in the total irrigation fluid used between the two groups was observed. Of the 27 patients who received room temperature irrigation fluid, 15 (55.6%) had a decrease in body temperature. A decrease in temperature was observed in 21 (72.4%) of the 29 patients who received warm irrigation fluid. Groups 1 and 2 had 12 (44.4%) of 27 and 8 (27.6%) of 29 patients, respectively, who demonstrated an elevation in their core body temperature.
CONCLUSIONS The results of our study suggest that irrigation fluid temperature is not a factor responsible for altering the core body temperature in patients undergoing TURP.
