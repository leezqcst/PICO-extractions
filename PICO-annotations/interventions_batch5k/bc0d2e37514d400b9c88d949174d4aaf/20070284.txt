Changes in quality of life and sexual health are associated with low-dose peginterferon therapy and disease progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

BACKGROUND Primary analysis of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial showed long-term peginterferon therapy did not reduce complications in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
AIM To assess the effects of long-term peginterferon therapy and disease progression on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), symptoms and sexual health in HALT-C patients.
METHODS A total of 517 HALT-C patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (90 microg/week); 532 received no additional treatment for 3.5 years. Patients were followed up for outcomes of death, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation. Sexual health, SF-36 scores and symptoms were serially assessed by repeated-measures analyses of covariance.
RESULTS Patients with cirrhosis (n = 427) reported lower general well-being and more fatigue (P < 0.001) than patients with fibrosis (n = 622). Physical scores declined significantly over time, independent of treatment, and patients with cirrhosis reported lower scores. Vitality scores were lower in those with cirrhosis, and treated patients experienced a greater decline over time than untreated patients; HRQOL rebounded after treatment ended. Patients with a clinical outcome had significantly greater declines in all SF-36 and symptom scores. Among men, Sexual Health scores were significantly worse in treated patients and in those with a clinical outcome.
CONCLUSION Clinical progression of chronic hepatitis C and maintenance peginterferon therapy led to worsening of symptoms, HRQOL and, in men, sexual health in a large patient cohort followed up over 4 years (NCT00006164).
