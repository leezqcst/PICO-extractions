Dihydroergocryptine in the management of senile psycho-organic syndrome.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study is described of an assessment of the efficacy and relative safety of the ergot alkaloid, dihydroergocryptine, on 52 patients with mild organic brain syndrome over a period of three months using a series of neurophysiological tests. The results indicated that short-term treatment with the alkaloid improved memory impairment. The side-effects were mild and transient in both the dihydroergocryptine and placebo groups and there were no alterations in blood chemistry.
