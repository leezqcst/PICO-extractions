T1	Intervention 147 701	To examine whether it is possible to evaluate the degree of ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced inflammation by measuring the degree of hyperpigmentation, we investigated the relationship between UVB-induced erythema and the subsequent pigmentation quantitatively. At 24 h and 7 d after irradiation with erythemogenic doses of UVB to the backs of 16 Japanese subjects, the degree of induced erythema (delta erythema index) and that of pigmentation (delta melanin index) were examined by an image analytic method using a videomicroscope interfaced with a computer
