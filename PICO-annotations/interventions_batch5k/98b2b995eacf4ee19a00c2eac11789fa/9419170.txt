The effect of valaciclovir on cytomegalovirus viremia and viruria detected by polymerase chain reaction in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease. AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 204/Glaxo Wellcome 123-014 International CMV Prophylaxis Study Group.

Samples of blood and urine were collected at baseline, week 4, and week 8 and then every 8 weeks from 310 patients entering a controlled trial of prophylaxis with valaciclovir versus acyclovir. Samples were tested under code by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in one laboratory. The median number of samples collected from each patient was 5 for blood (range, 0-15) and 5 for urine (range, 0-15). Both baseline PCR viremia and PCR viruria were significantly associated with future cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (P = .002 and P = .02, respectively). The greatest effect of valaciclovir on CMV disease was seen in patients who were PCR-positive in blood at baseline (P = .002), although a significant effect was also seen in those who were PCR-negative in urine (P = .02). Thus, PCR viremia provides prognostic information about CMV disease in AIDS patients, and valaciclovir showed activity as both a preemptive and prophylactic agent.
