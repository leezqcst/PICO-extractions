Effect of six-hour exposure to nitrogen dioxide on early-phase nasal response to allergen challenge in patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

BACKGROUND Recent studies have suggested that exposure to air pollutants may enhance the airway responsiveness of susceptible individuals to inhaled allergen.
METHODS To investigate the effect of exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on nasal airways resistance (NAR) and inflammatory mediators in nasal lavage fluid, eight subjects with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, who were tested out of season, were exposed in a randomized single-blind, crossover study to either air or 400 ppb NO2 for 6 hours. The changes in NAR and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), mast cell tryptase (MCT), neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in nasal lavage fluid before and after exposure were evaluated. Another group of eight subjects with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis were also randomized to exposure to air or 400 ppb NO2 for 6 hours and then challenged with allergen, before evaluation for changes in NAR and changes in ECP, MCT, MPO, and IL-8 in nasal lavage fluid.
RESULTS Exposure to air or NO2 did not alter either NAR or the levels of ECP, MCT, MPO, or IL-8 in nasal lavage fluid. Allergen challenge after exposure to both air and NO2 significantly (p < 0.05) increased levels of MCT, but not MPO and IL-8 in the nasal lavage fluid. In addition, allergen challenge after exposure to NO2 but not air, significantly increased levels of only ECP in nasal lavage fluid (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that acute exposure to NO2 at concentrations found at the curbside in heavy traffic during episodes of pollution, may "prime" eosinophils for subsequent activation by allergen in individuals with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
