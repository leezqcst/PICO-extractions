The management of dermoid cysts--a comparative study of laparoscopy and laparotomy.

The aim of our study was to compare laparoscopy with laparotomy for the removal of ovarian dermoid cysts. Thirty-eight women with benign ovarian dermoid cyst were allocated for either laparoscopy (18 patients) or laparotomy (20 patients). The two groups were compared for operative and hospitalization times and postoperative course. Operating time was longer (93.6 +/- 23.8 min) and hospitalization time significantly shorter (22.4 +/- 6.6 h) in the laparoscopy group. No complications were reported in either group. We conclude that operative laparoscopy is a safe procedure for the removal of dermoid ovarian cysts and is as effective as laparotomy.
