Effect of upper arm brachial basilic and prosthetic forearm arteriovenous fistula on left ventricular hypertrophy.

BACKGROUND Creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) may increase left ventricular hypertrophy in the hemodialysis population. Aim of this study was to compare the effects of a brachial-basilic (BB) AVF and the prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop access (PTFE) on cardiac performance.
METHODS Patients were randomized to receive BB-AVF or prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop access. Before and three months after AVF creation patients underwent an echocardiographic examination. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare relative increase between the measured cardiac parameters for the two groups.
RESULTS Twenty-seven patients participated in the study. The relative increase in left ventricular parameters was not significantly different between the two groups. Only left ventricular end-diastolic diameter tended to be of significance. Mean blood flow through the brachial artery was 1680+/-156 and 1450+/-221 mL/min three months after surgery for the PTFE and the BB-AVF group, respectively.
CONCLUSION After three months of follow-up, changes in cardiac structure were comparable between patients with BB and PTFE AVFs. Also access flow was comparable at this time. In general, the effects of creation of a fistula on LV structure were limited. Longer follow up time may be needed to explore the long term effects of different vascular accesses on cardiac function.
