Effects of resistance versus endurance training on serum adiponectin and insulin resistance index.

PURPOSE The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of resistance and endurance training on serum adiponectin and insulin resistance index (SI) in healthy men.
METHODS Twenty-four healthy males (age, 35-48 years) participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: endurance training group (n=8), resistance training group (n=8) and control group (n=8). Blood samples were taken in fasting state from all subjects. The experimental groups performed either endurance or resistance training 3 days a week for 12 weeks. The endurance training programme included continuous running at an intensity corresponding to 75-85% of maximal heart rate, while resistance training consisted of four sets of circuit weight training for 11 stations and at an intensity corresponding to 50-60% of one-repetition maximum. The maximum numbers of repetitions in each station was 12.
RESULTS There were significant negative correlations between serum adiponectin and body fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index and the insulin resistance index at baseline, whereas changes in response to training were not significantly correlated. Both endurance and resistance training resulted in a significant decrease in the SI in comparison with the control group. However, serum adiponectin did not change significantly in response to resistance and endurance training.
CONCLUSION Endurance and resistance training caused an improvement in insulin resistance in healthy men, but this improvement was not accompanied by increased adiponectin levels.
