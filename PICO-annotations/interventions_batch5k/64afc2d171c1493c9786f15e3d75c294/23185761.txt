[Therapeutic efficacy of youdujing preparation in treating cervical high-risk human papilloma virus infection patients].

OBJECTIVE To study the clinical efficacy and mechanisms of Youdujing (YDJ) preparation in treating the cervical high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) infection.
METHODS Totally HR-HPV infection 70 patients were assigned to the treatment group and the control group using random single blind method, 35 cases in each group. YDJ external lotion and YDJ cream were applied to patients in the treatment group, while normal saline was applied for those in the control group. HR-HPV DNA detection was performed by the end of the 1st menstruation after 3 menstrual cycles. The cervical biopsy and cervical smear were performed using vaginoscope before and after treatment. The mRNA expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was detected from fresh tissues of the cervical lesion.
RESULTS The total effective rate was 96.6% in the treatment group, higher than that of the control group (70.00%, P<0.01). Before treatment there was no statistical difference in the pathological results of the cervix and the mRNA expression of hTERT between the two groups (P>0.05). The mRNA expression of hTERT decreased in the two groups after treatment, showing statistical difference (P<0.01). Better effects on the pathological results of the cervix and the mRNA expression of hTERT were obtained in the treatment group after treatment (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION YDJ played a role in clearing HR-HPV infection and reversing the cervical precancerous changes possibly through down-regulating the mRNA expression of hTERT and lowering the telomerase activation.
