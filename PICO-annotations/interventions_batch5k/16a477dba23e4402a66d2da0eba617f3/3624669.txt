Disopyramide-pyridostigmine interaction: selective reversal of anticholinergic symptoms with preservation of antiarrhythmic effect.

This double-blind, randomized, placebo crossover study was used to evaluate the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor--slow-release pyridostigmine (180 mg orally every 12 hours)--on the anticholinergic and antiarrhythmic properties of disopyramide. Quantitative side effects questionnaire scores were used to guide disopyramide administration in 20 men with ventricular tachycardia. Disopyramide was given to each patient both with placebo and with active pyridostigmine. The maximal administered dose for each regimen was used in conjunction with corresponding questionnaire scores to calculate an index or estimate of the maximal tolerable dose of disopyramide. Additional evaluations performed at baseline and at each maximal administered dose regimen included tear and saliva quantitation, 24 hour electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise testing and programmed ventricular stimulation. Results showed that the maximal administered dose of disopyramide was greater with active pyridostigmine than with placebo: 295 +/- 75 versus 245 +/- 100 mg every 6 hours (p less than 0.05). The calculated maximal tolerable dose was substantially greater in the presence of pyridostigmine: 355 +/- 90 versus 260 +/- 115 mg every 6 hours (p less than 0.001). Maximal side effects questionnaire scores also reflected decreased anticholinergic activity in the presence of pyridostigmine compared with placebo: 101.9 +/- 2.2 versus 104.6 +/- 2.8, respectively (p less than 0.005). Baseline tear and saliva production was significantly reduced during disopyramide therapy, but was restored toward normal by the addition of pyridostigmine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
