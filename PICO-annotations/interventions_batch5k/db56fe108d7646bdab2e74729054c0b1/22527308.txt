Successful treatment of blepharitis with bibrocathol (Posiformin® 2 %).

BACKGROUND Bibrocathol is a well-established antiseptic drug for the treatment of acute eyelid diseases like blepharitis. Despite its frequent use in clinical practice, no controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of bibrocathol 2% eye ointment has been performed until now. The aim of the study was to investigate efficacy, safety and tolerability of bibrocathol (Posiformin® 2 %) eye ointment in patients diagnosed with blepharitis.
METHODS In this multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled parallel-group comparison, the change of signs and symptoms (sum score) of blepharitis in 197 patients (ITT (intention-to-treat-group); mean age 56 ± 18 years, 56 % female, active drug:vehicle = 97:100) over 2 weeks treatment with bibrocathol 2 % eye ointment was evaluated.
RESULTS Patients receiving bibrocathol 2 % showed greater improvement in the sum score than the placebo patients (p < 0.0001, Cohen's effect size d = 0.73). Also, the results from further efficacy assessments improvement of single symptoms and ocular discomfort measured by a VAS (visual analogue scale) supported treatment with bibrocathol. Patients and investigators provided favorable tolerability ratings preferring bibrocathol over placebo. No safety issues were observed with regard to intraocular pressure, visual acuity, or occurrence of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS Blepharitis therapy with the antiseptic bibrocathol 2 % in this trial was highly efficacious and safe.
