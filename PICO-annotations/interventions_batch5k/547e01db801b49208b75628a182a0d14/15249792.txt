Effect of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet and reduced sodium intake on blood pressure control.

The authors hypothesized that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and reduced sodium intake would control stage 1 hypertension and reduce high-normal blood pressure (BP) to optimal levels. Adults with systolic BP 120-159 mm Hg and diastolic BP 80-95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive the DASH diet or a typical American (control) diet, consuming three different sodium intakes (higher=142 mmol/d, intermediate=107 mmol/d, and lower=65 mmol/d) for 30 days each. BP control was defined as systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg. Among subjects with hypertension at baseline, at higher sodium intake the DASH diet increased BP control two-fold over control (63% vs. 32%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.9). Reducing sodium intake in the control diet group increased BP control 2.3-fold (74% vs. 32%; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-3.2). The maximum BP control rate (84%) was achieved with the DASH/lower sodium diet. BP became normal or optimal in 71% of persons consuming the control/lower sodium diet and 77% of persons consuming the DASH/lower sodium diet. Both the DASH diet and reduced sodium intake improved BP control.
