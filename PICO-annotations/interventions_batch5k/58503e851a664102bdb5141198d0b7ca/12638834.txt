Evaluation of 25-gauge Quincke and 24-gauge Gertie Marx needles for spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.

OBJECTIVE To compare the insertion characteristics and rate of complications between 25-gauge Quincke and 24-gauge Gertie Marx needles.
DESIGN Prospective, randomized study.
SETTING University of Benin Teaching Hospital; a university-affiliated tertiary centre.
SUBJECTS Parturients (ASA 1 and 2) scheduled for elective caesarean section. They were randomly assigned to receive spinal anaesthesia with either 25-gauge Quincke needle or 24-gauge Gertie Marx needle. The patients with abnormal spaces, coagulopathy, infection, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia or obesity were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The number of attempts at successful identification of the spinal space, intraoperative complications, incidence of postdural puncture headache (PDPH), non-postdural puncture headache (NPDPH) and backache.
RESULTS Sixty women were studied. The 24-gauge Gertie Marx needle resulted in more successful location of the spinal space on the second attempt (P<0.05). Non-postdural puncture headache was seen in 43% of the study population. PDPH was seen in 10% of the Quincke group and none in the Gertie Marx group. There was no difference in the incidence of backache in both groups.
CONCLUSION The ease of insertion and low incidence of PDPH with the Gertie Marx needle may encourage trainee anaesthetists to use this needle for caesarean section.
