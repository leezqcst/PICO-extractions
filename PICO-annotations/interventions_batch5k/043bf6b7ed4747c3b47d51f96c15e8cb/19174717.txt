Bevacizumab compared with macular laser grid photocoagulation for cystoid macular edema in branch retinal vein occlusion.

INTRODUCTION To evaluate the outcome of cystoid macular edema treated with intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and macular grid laser photocoagulation (GLP), in patients with perfused branch retinal vein occlusion.
METHODS Thirty eyes of 30 consecutive patients with cystoid macular edema secondary to nonischemic branch retinal vein occlusion were assigned to either GLP group or to intravitreal bevacizumab (IB) group. Complete ophthalmologic examinations were performed just before GLP and IB injection at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Changes in logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT) shown by optical coherence tomography-3 were evaluated.
RESULTS Baseline BCVA (logMAR) and CMT were, respectively, 0.89 +/- 0.13 and 650 +/- 140 microm for the GLP group, 0.87 +/- 0.16 and 690 +/- 120 microm for the IB group. After the treatment, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in the GLP group, BCVA had improved by 0.19, 0.22, 0.21, and 0.20 logMAR, CMT had decreased by 40%, 41.3%, 40.5%, and 42%. In the IB group, BCVA had improved by 0.31, 0.32, 0.30, and 0.31 logMAR and CMT had decreased by 59.5%, 59%, 60%, and 60.3%. The group receiving bevacizumab had better BCVA and lower CMT values at all time points (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION Intravitreal bevacizumab injection improves BCVA and reduces CMT more than GLP. Intravitreal bevacizumab injection was well tolerated and could be used as primary treatment in patients with cystoid macular edema secondary to perfused branch retinal vein occlusion.
