T1	Intervention 120 670	The caries-preventive effects of two toothpastes were tested in a 3-year clinical trial involving 1319 children aged 11-13 years. The test toothpastes were: 1) a low abrasion paste containing 0.8% sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP), and 2) a paste containing 3% sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP). The control toothpaste was a conventional, moderately abrasive paste containing 0.8% sodium monofluorophosphate. The children were examined clinically and radiologically each year. Toothpaste was supplied to the children's homes, and its use was unsupervised.
