The paroxetine 352 bipolar trial: A study in medical ghostwriting.

BACKGROUND The problem of ghostwriting in corporate-sponsored clinical trials is of concern to medicine, bioethics, and government agencies. We present a study of the ghostwritten archival report of an industry-sponsored trial comparing antidepressant treatments for bipolar depression: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) paroxetine study 352. This analysis is based upon publicly available evidence presented in a complaint of research misconduct filed with the Office of Research Integrity of the Department of Health and Human Services.
OBJECTIVES We performed a deconstruction of the published study to show how primary and secondary outcome analyses were conflated, turning a 'negative' clinical trial into a 'positive' study - with conclusions and recommendations that could adversely affect patient health.
METHODS The paroxetine 352 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 19-site trial comparing paroxetine and imipramine in 117 patients with bipolar type I major depressive episode which was unresponsive to prior lithium carbonate therapy.
RESULTS Analysis of the primary outcome measures found no statistically significant difference between paroxetine or imipramine versus placebo. However, the published article concluded that both drugs were efficacious versus placebo for a post hoc subgroup of patients.
CONCLUSIONS Few industry-sponsored studies gain public scrutiny. It is important to make these articles transparent to the scientific and medical community.
