T1	Intervention 361 783	In a double-blind, placebo, cross-over study, nine healthy volunteers were given intravenous lidocaine (or saline) to approximate the plasma levels of lidocaine achieved during epidural anesthesia for major abdominal surgery. Five volunteers were studied in a warm room (to test for nonthermoregulatory tremor), and four volunteers were studied in a cold room (to test the effects of lidocaine on normal thermoregulation).
