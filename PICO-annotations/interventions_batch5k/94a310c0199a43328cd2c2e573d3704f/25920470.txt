Effect of motor training involving the less-affected side (MTLA) in post-stroke subjects: a pilot randomized controlled trial.

INTRODUCTION Poststroke, less-severe motor impairment occurs on the ipsilesional side of body. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the motor training involving the less-affected side (MTLA) in stroke.
METHODS This was a randomized, controlled, double-blinded pilot study conducted in the occupational therapy unit of a rehabilitation Institute. A convenience sample of 35 stroke subjects (mean poststroke duration, 28.76 weeks) was randomized into two groups (the experimental group: 17 and control group: 18). Thirty-two participants completed the entire study protocol. The experimental group and control group were provided MTLA and neurophysiological-based conventional therapy respectively. Both the groups received 24 treatment sessions (60 minutes each) over the period of two months. The Affected side was assessed using Brunnstrom recovery stage (BRS) and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) whereas the less-affected side was evaluated by Minnesota manual dexterity test (MMDT), Purdue peg board test (PPBT) and Manual Muscle Testing (MMT).
RESULTS Postintervention, the less-affected side of experimental group demonstrated significant improvement for MMDT (P = 0.003), PPBT (P = 0.01) and MMT (P <  0.001 to 0.043) in comparison to the control group. Further, as compared to the control group, the experimental group exhibited positive significant change for the measure of affected side [BRS (P <  0.001) and FMA (P <  0.001 to 0.03)] at post assessment.
CONCLUSION MTLA enhanced the muscle strength, dexterity and coordination of the less-affected side as well as the motor recovery of the affected side in poststroke hemiparetic subjects.
