A comparison between oral ciprofloxacin and intra-peritoneal vancomycin and gentamicin in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis.

Fifty-one patients were included in a prospective, randomized comparison of oral ciprofloxacin and intraperitoneal vancomycin/gentamicin in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis. Staphylococcal species accounted for 40% of the isolates with an equal incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci. Although, overall, there was no significant difference between the regimens in outcome, ciprofloxacin was significantly less effective when peritonitis was due to coagulase negative staphylococci.
