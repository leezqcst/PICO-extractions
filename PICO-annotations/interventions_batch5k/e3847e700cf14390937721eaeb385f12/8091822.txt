[The anti-ischemic effect of phosphodiesterase III inhibitors].

When enoximone is acutely administered to patients with stable angina and angiographically proven relevant coronary stenosis i.v. application of 0.75 mg/kg exhibits pronounced antiischemic effects. This could be observed in patients during exercise and in those in whom the ischemia was provoked by rapid cardiac stimulation. The antiischemic effects were documented by relief of symptoms, reduction of ST-depression, improvement of impaired myocardial wall motion, decrease to normalization of pathologically elevated filling pressure, amelioration of coronary blood flow as evidenced by myocard scintigraphy and washout time of an intracoronarily injected echo-contrast medium. There was also a definite improvement of ischemia-caused mitral regurgitation. Similar observations were found when the drug was injected in the diseased coronary arteries in a small dose (0.075 mg/kg) so that peripheral effects were not present. In comparison to the Ca(++)-blocker Gallopamil the antiischemic effects of Enoximone were more pronounced, a synergistic action was, however, observed. Negative dromotropic effects of Gallopamil could be abolished by Enoximone. With oral administration of the drug over a period of one week antiischemic effects could also be documented with Holter monitoring as well as during exercise. There was a reduction of ST-depression both at spontaneously occurring ischemic episodes and during exercise, in the number and duration of episodes of silent ischemia, particularly, however, a decrease in symptomatic episodes. In none of the patients under study proarrhythmic effects were observed.
