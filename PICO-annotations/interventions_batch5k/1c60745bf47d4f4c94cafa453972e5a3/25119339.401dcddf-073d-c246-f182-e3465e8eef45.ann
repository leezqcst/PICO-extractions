T1	Intervention 426 757	We randomized 285 low-birth-weight infants (2,000-2,500 g) into three intervention groups receiving 0, 1, or 2 mg/kg/d of iron supplements from 6 wk to 6 mo of age. In the present secondary analysis, we analyzed iron status, total hemoglobin (Hb), and HbF fraction at 6 wk, 12 wk, and at 6 mo and calculated absolute levels of HbF.
