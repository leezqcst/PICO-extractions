T1	Intervention 380 1258	The study group consisted of 26 healthy adolescents (mean age 14.6 years) exhibiting 60 teeth with 152 visible WSL sites on incisors and canines immediately after debonding of fixed orthodontic appliances. After bracket removal, professional tooth cleaning and drying, a visual scoring (0-4) and laser fluorescence (LF) readings were carried out. The patients were randomly assigned to two different treatment protocols with the aim of remineralising the lesions: A) daily topical applications of a dental cream containing CPP-ACP (Topacal) for 3 months followed by a 3-month period of daily toothbrushing with fluoridated dentifrice, or B) daily 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthwash combined with fluoridated dentifrice for 6 months. The registrations were repeated after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and follow-up data were compared with baseline with aid of chi-square and paired t-tests
