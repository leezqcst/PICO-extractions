Acipimox in the treatment of patients with hyperlipidaemia: a double blind trial.

Fifty-two patients with Fredrickson Type IIb or Type IV hyperlipidaemia, in whom diet had not achieved satisfactory lipid levels, completed a double blind randomised study of acipimox versus placebo. The patients were given acipimox, 250 mg three times daily or placebo for a three month period, and plasma lipids and glucose were monitored. The patients receiving acipimox showed a fall in the mean concentration of plasma triglyceride compared to placebo (0.74 mmol/l) and this was most marked in patients whose initial plasma triglyceride levels were greater than 3 mmol/l (1.0 mmol/l, confidence limits 0.18, 1.82). Acipimox was well tolerated, and could be a useful addition to the drugs available for the treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridaemia.
