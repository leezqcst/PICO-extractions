Early immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine: a five-year study.

We evaluated the response to the recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine using an accelerated schedule versus the traditional schedule by studying the immunologic memory induced in 200 children with HBs-Ag negative mothers. At seroconversion, the traditional schedule presented a higher percentage of children with serum HBs-Ag concentrations over 100 mIU/ml than the accelerated schedule. After five years this difference was no longer statistically significant and children who presented anti-HBsAg concentrations below 10 mUI/ml received an additional booster dose which stimulated the antibody concentration to exceed 100 mIU/ml in all cases. Recombinant HBV vaccine induced better long term immunologic memory when it was administered earlier.
