T1	Intervention 0 73	Infrared LED irradiation applied during high-intensity treadmill training
T2	Intervention 338 454	LED irradiation (850 nm) applied during treadmill training on the maximal exercise tolerance in postmenopausal women
T3	Intervention 625 963	(1) the LED group (treadmill training associated with phototherapy, n = 10), (2) the exercise group (treadmill training, n = 10), and (3) the sedentary group (neither physical training nor phototherapy, n = 10). The training was performed for 45 min twice a week for 6 months at intensities between 85% and 90% maximal heart rate (HRmax).
T4	Intervention 1037 1108	cardiovascular parameters were measured at baseline and after 6 months.
T5	Intervention 968 1031	irradiation parameters were 39 mW/cm(2), 45 min and 108 J/cm(2)
