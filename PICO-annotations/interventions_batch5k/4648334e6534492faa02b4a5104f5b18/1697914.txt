Use of an alpha 1-blocker, YM617, in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy. YM617 Clinical Study Group.

A recently synthesized alpha 1-blocker, (R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]propyl]-2- methoxybenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride (YM617), was evaluated in 270 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy in a double-blind study. After 2 weeks on placebo the patients were assigned at random to 4 groups: group P--placebo, group L--0.1 mg., group M--0.2 mg. and group H--0.4 mg. of YM617. Comparing the placebo to the treatment period, subjective symptoms, such as nocturia and urgency, were significantly decreased in group H (p less than 0.01). The sensation of incomplete voiding was significantly improved in groups M and H (p less than 0.01). However, the differences among the groups were statistically insignificant. Residual urine volume was significantly decreased in groups L, M and H after instillation of saline into the bladder (p less than 0.01) but not in group P. The maximum and average flow rates were significantly increased in groups L, M and H (p less than 0.01) but not in group P. Average flow rate showed significant differences between groups M or H versus group P. Neither orthostatic hypotension nor a decrease in blood pressure was noted. Adverse side effects and changes in laboratory data were all slight and disappeared when the second tests were performed. In summary, the irritative and obstructive symptoms caused by benign prostatic hypertrophy were decreased and urodynamic studies were markedly improved by the alpha 1-blocker, YM617. The drug seems to be useful in the treatment of patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy.
