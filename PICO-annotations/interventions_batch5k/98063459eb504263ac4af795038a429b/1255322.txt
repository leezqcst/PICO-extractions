Variance in albumin loading in exchange transfusions.

To assess the rationale of albumin priming prior to exchange transfusions, 42 hyperbilirubinemic infants who required exchange transfusions were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group I consisted of 15 infants who were given intravenously 1 gm/kg of salt-poor human serum albumin one hour before the exchanges. Group II, which consisted of 27 infants, received simple exchanges. No statistical differences were found in variations in reserve albumin-binding capacity, bilirubin, albumin, or red cell bilirubin at pre and one-hour post albumin infusion in the primed infants. The amount of bilirubin removed per kilogram is directly correlated to plasma bilirubin concentration (r=0.87). No significant difference in efficiency on bilirubin removal was seen between the two groups. Beneficial effects of albumin therapy was apparent only in those infants with low RABC as determined by the sephadex gel filtration technique.
