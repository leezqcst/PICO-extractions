T1	Intervention 14 80	single- and dual-coil active pectoral defibrillation lead systems.
T2	Intervention 134 159	defibrillation thresholds
T3	Intervention 500 568	to allow for smaller pulse generators with a reduced maximal output.
T4	Intervention 736 742	Shocks
T5	Intervention 1330 1414	Leading edge voltage (p < 0.001) and shock impedance (p < 0.001) were also decreased
T6	Intervention 1458 1484	peak current was increased
T7	Intervention 1551 1645	reduces defibrillation energy requirements compared with a single-coil, unipolar configuration
