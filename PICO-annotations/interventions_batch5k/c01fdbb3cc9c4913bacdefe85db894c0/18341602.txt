A double-blind randomized clinical evaluation of enamel matrix derivative proteins for the treatment of proximal class-II furcation involvements.

OBJECTIVE The aim of the present randomized, double-blind study was to evaluate the clinical response of proximal furcations treated with enamel matrix derivative proteins (EMD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifteen patients, each with a pair of contralateral class-II proximal furcation involvements, presenting probing depths (PDs) >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) were selected. The patients were randomly assigned to: control group (n=15) - open flap debridement (OFD)+24% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) conditioning; test group (n=15) - OFD+24% EDTA conditioning+EMD application. Plaque index (PI), BOP, PD, gingival margin position (GMP), relative vertical and horizontal clinical attachment level (RVCAL and RHCAL), vertical and horizontal bone level (VBL and HBL) and furcation closure were evaluated immediately before and 2, 4 and 6 months after the surgeries.
RESULTS At 6 months, the RVCAL gains of the control and test group were 0.39 +/- 1.00 and 0.54 +/- 0.95 mm, while the RHCAL gains were 1.21 +/- 2.28 and 1.36 +/- 1.26 mm (p>0.05). The VBL and HBL gains of the control group were 1.04 +/- 1.12 and 1.00 +/- 1.79 mm, and 0.82 +/- 1.82 and 1.17 +/- 1.38 mm for the test group (p>0.05). In addition, a statistical difference was observed in the number of the remaining class-II furcations between the test and control groups (p<0.05) in this period.
CONCLUSION It may be concluded that the use of EMD in proximal furcations did not promote a superior reduction in PD or a gain in clinical and osseous attachment levels, but resulted in a higher rate of class-II to class-I furcation conversion.
