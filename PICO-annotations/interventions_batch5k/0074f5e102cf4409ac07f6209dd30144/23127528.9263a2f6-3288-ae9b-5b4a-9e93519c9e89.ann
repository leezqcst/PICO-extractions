T1	Intervention 0 31	Monitoring of CA19-9 and SPan-1
T2	Intervention 290 387	monitoring of serum tumor markers (TMs), namely carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, DUPAN-2, SPan-1
T3	Intervention 455 560	Monitoring of serum TMs and computed tomography were performed every 4 weeks until progression of disease
T4	Intervention 619 811	Group A (January 2006-October 2007), we analyzed the fluctuation rates of TMs with high pretreatment positive rates, and defined the criteria of progressive disease under TM monitoring (TM-PD)
T5	Intervention 816 982	Group B (November 2007-October 2008), we calculated the time to progression (TTP) under this TM-PD criteria, which was compared with the TTP under the RECIST criteria
T6	Intervention 1595 1632	Monitoring of serum CA19-9 and SPan-1
