T2	Intervention 0 117;119 1159	Combined therapy in the treatment of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma: conventional versus escalated chemotherapy. Treatment of patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) remains controversial. We started a controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a conventional versus more intensive regimen of combined chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the mediastinum with the mantle technique. From 1989 to 1997, 68 patients diagnosed with previously untreated PMBCL, aged 18-65 years and negative for immunodeficiency virus test, were considered candidates to receive either conventional chemotherapy with CEOP-Bleo (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2), prednisone 40 mg/m(2), epirubicin 70 mg/m(2), and bleomycin 10 mg/m(2)) or mega CEOP-Bleo (cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m(2), epirubicin 120 mg/m(2), vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin at the same doses) every 21 days for six cycles, followed by radiotherapy to the mediastinum with the mantle technique (35-45 Gy, mean 38 Gy). Complete response (CR) rates were not statistically different: 64% [95 percent confidence interval (CI): 58 percent to
