T1	Intervention 869 1666	Women, aged 18-34 years, with no contraindications to the use of combined OCs, were randomized to three cycles of treatment with a CVR delivering NES/EE (150/15 microg/day) or a combined OC providing LNG and EE (150/30 microg per tablet). Each cycle consisted of 21 days of active treatment, followed by 7 days without treatment. During the last weeks of the pretreatment and third treatment cycles, blood samples were obtained for determinations of plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen, an estrogen-sensitive hepatic protein, and serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and estrogen- and androgen-sensitive proteins. BP was also measured
