Effects of strontium on the quality of bone apatite crystals: a paired biopsy study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women.

UNLABELLED In paired biopsies of osteoporotic women treated with either strontium ranelate or a placebo for 36 months, characteristics of bone apatite crystals were not influenced by the presence of strontium. The mean rate of substitutions of calcium by strontium ions was 4.5 %.
INTRODUCTION The potential effect of strontium (Sr) on bone apatite crystals was investigated in paired biopsies of osteoporotic women treated with either strontium ranelate (SrRan) or a placebo for 36 months.
METHODS In ten paired biopsies, crystallinity, apparent length and width/thickness of crystals, interplanar distances, and lattice parameters of unit cells were assessed by X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction.
RESULTS All these parameters, reflecting crystal and unit cell characteristics, were not influenced by the presence of Sr and were similar in SrRan and placebo groups after 36 months of treatment. The mean rate of substitutions of calcium by Sr ions was 4.5 %.
CONCLUSION Overall, the quality of bone apatite crystals was maintained after 36 months of treatment with SrRan.
