Torasemide versus furosemide in cirrhosis: a long-term, double-blind, randomized clinical study.

The effects of long-term therapy (70 days) with torasemide (20 mg/day), a new loop diuretic, were compared with those of furosemide (50 mg/day) in a randomized double-blind trial. Both drugs were administered in association with spironolactone (200 mg/day) in 28 nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with controlled ascites. The treatments did not modify creatinine clearance and exhibited a similar effect on body weight, urinary volume, and fractional excretion of uric acid, sodium, and chloride. The effect of torasemide on fractional potassium excretion was lower than that of furosemide. Torasemide showed higher sparing effect than furosemide on calcium, inorganic phosphate, and magnesium excretion and stronger action on free water clearance. No changes in serum parameters were induced by either treatment. Two episodes of hepatic encephalopathy occurred in the torasemide group. In view of its effects on sodium and water excretion and on other urinary parameters, torasemide can represent an alternative tool for the long-term treatment of ascites.
