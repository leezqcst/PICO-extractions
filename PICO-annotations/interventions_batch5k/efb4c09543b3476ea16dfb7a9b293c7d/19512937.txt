Loss of bone mineral density after antiretroviral therapy initiation, independent of antiretroviral regimen.

BACKGROUND Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) has been described in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), but the contributions of ART and immunologic and/or virologic factors remain unclear.
METHODS We compared total BMD changes over 96 weeks in 106 ART-naive HIV-infected subjects who were randomized to receive efavirenz (EFV) + zidovudine/lamivudine (n = 32) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) + zidovudine/lamivudine induction (n = 74) for 24-48 weeks followed by LPV/r monotherapy. We also sought to identify factors associated with BMD loss, including markers of systemic inflammation [soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors (sTNFR I and II)].
RESULTS After 96 weeks, the mean percent change from baseline in total BMD was -2.5% (LPV/r) and -2.3% (EFV) (P < 0.01 for within-group changes in either arm; P = 0.86 for between-group differences). No alteration in the rate of BMD change was observed upon simplification to LPV/r monotherapy. Although soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor II concentrations at baseline and 24 weeks were at least marginally associated with subsequent changes in BMD (P = 0.06 and P = 0.028, respectively), these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for CD4 T cell count. Subjects with lower baseline CD4 T cell count, non-black race, and higher baseline glucose demonstrated a higher risk for >5% decrease in BMD.
CONCLUSIONS Similar decreases in BMD over 96 weeks occurred in ART-naive subjects receiving either EFV-based regimen or LPV/r-based regimen, which was not altered by simplification to LPV/r monotherapy and was unrelated to markers of tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity.
