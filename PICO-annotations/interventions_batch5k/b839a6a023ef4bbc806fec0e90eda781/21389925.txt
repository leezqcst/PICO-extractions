Role of oxidized regenerated cellulose in preventing infections at the surgical site: prospective, randomized study in 98 patients affected by a dirty wound.

AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate whether oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), applied to "dirty" surgical wounds, is able to reduce the microbial load and, consequently, the infection rate as compared to conventional local wound treatment.
METHODS The study included 98 patients who underwent intestinal recanalization procedures between December 2003 and December 2008, with the stoma as the surgical site. Authors considered several risk factors for SSI. The patients were divided into two groups. In group A (50 patients), the surgical wound, previous site of the stoma, was packed with ORC, whereas in group B (48 patients) gauze soaked in iodine was used. Microbial contamination was evaluated with three swabs (in subcutaneous tissue and the dermis), in the operating room before wound packing and on the 2nd and 3rd postoperative day (before suturing the skin).
RESULTS There were no cases of wound dehiscence and no clinically evident superficial or deep surgical site infections in either group. Analysis of all data revealed that there was no or reduced bacterial contamination in the second and third swab in 33 patients (66%) of Group A versus 12 patients (25%) of Group B.
CONCLUSION Although it is necessary to consider all factors which can have an influence on SSI and use all the means shown to be effective to reduce the risk of SSI, there is a rationale for using ORC to prevent this kind of infection, especially in patients who undergo "dirty" surgery.
