Association of race with complications and prognosis following acute coronary syndromes.

The baseline characteristics, complications, and survival of 489 black and 6,890 non-black patients with acute coronary syndromes were studied. Important racial differences were observed in demographic features, atherosclerosis risk factors, and treatment strategies; however, despite these differences, no independent difference was observed in clinical outcomes according to race. The 1-year mortality rate was 2.9% for black patients and 2.5% for non-black patients (p = 0.93).
