[Comparison between anterior rhinomanometry and impulse-oscillometric rhinometry found within nasal allergen provocation].

UNLABELLED Besides the standard method of anterior rhinomanometry (aR), the impulse-oscillometric rhinometry (IOS) is available for measurements of the nasal resistance. The aR is a procedure dependent on the cooperation of the patient, whereas IOS is measured regardless from the breathing activities of the patient. We examined weather the resistance-measurement by means of IOS in comparison to the aR is a more suitable method for nasal allergic provocation.
METHOD 17 patients with anamnestic known rhinokonjunktivitis (6 f, 11 m) had a pricktest and then a nasal provocation testing with an allergen which provoked a reaction on the skin. The complete resistance of the nose was measured in a randomized order by means of aR and IOS.
RESULTS The complete resistance showed neither in the basic measurement (aR 0,38 +/- 0,14 kPa/l/s; IOS 0,38 +/- 0,11 kPa/l/s) nor in the control solution (aR 0,38 +/- 0,14; IOS 0,39 +/- 0,14) nor after application of the allergenic solution (15 min: aR 0,69 +/- 0,27; IOS 0,77 +/- 0,42; 30 min: aR 0,65 +/- 0,29; IOS 0,6 +/- 0,38) a significant difference between the two methods. The results of the measurement of aR and IOS after the allergenic solution showed a positive correlation (15 min: r = 0,63, p < 0,01; 30 min: r = 0,67, p < 0,01). We found by means of clinic and measurement methods in the aR of 7 patients a positive reaction, within 7 patient a negative reaction, 3 patients had a unspecific nasal hyperreactivity. There was a correspondence in 6 of the 7 patients with positive reaction in aR between both methods. 4 of the 7 results with negative reaction in the aR would have been positive then underlying the same criteria in the IOS without announcing the symptomscore a relevant clinical symptomatic while testing.
CONCLUSION IOS is a suitable procedure for nasal provocation testing and provides results similar to the aR. In comparison to aR IOS is not dependent on the patients cooperation. Due to its higher sensitivity the valid limits of the aR at provocation testings cannot be transferred to IOS to avoid a false positive reaction.
