T1	Intervention 771 1265	Under fasting conditions, 24 healthy Egyptian male volunteers were randomly allocated to receive a single oral dose of either one FDC tablet or co-administration of two separate diflunisal and naproxen marketed tablets. Plasma samples were obtained over a 72-h interval and analyzed for diflunisal and naproxen by reversed phase liquid chromatography with UV detection.
