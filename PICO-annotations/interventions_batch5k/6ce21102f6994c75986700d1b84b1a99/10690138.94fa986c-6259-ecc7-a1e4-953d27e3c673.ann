T1	Intervention 98 642	We have compared the efficacy of 0.25% S(-)-bupivacaine with 0.25% RS-bupivacaine in providing epidural analgesia for labour in a randomized, multicentre, double-blind study. Analgesia was initiated with 10 ml of the study solution and maintained with 10-ml top-ups. We studied 137 women and treatments were found to be equivalent for onset, duration and quality of block. Median onset of pain relief was 12 min for both drugs and median duration was 49 (range 3-129) min and 51 (7-157) min for S(-)-bupivacaine and RS bupivacaine, respectively
