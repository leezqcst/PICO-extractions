T1	Intervention 728 873	This study compares early (European guideline) versus late (American/Canadian guideline) initiation of PN when EN fails to reach a caloric target
T2	Intervention 875 1179	In the early PN group, PN is initiated within 24-48 hours after ICU admission to complete early enteral nutrition (EN) up to a calculated nutritional target. In the late PN group, PN completing EN is initiated when the target is not reached on day 8. In both groups, the same early EN protocol is applied
