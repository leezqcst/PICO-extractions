T1	Intervention 582 1032	The EPaNIC trial is an investigator-initiated, non-commercial, multi-center, randomized, controlled, clinical trial with a parallel group design. This study compares early (European guideline) versus late (American/Canadian guideline) initiation of PN when EN fails to reach a caloric target. In the early PN group, PN is initiated within 24-48 hours after ICU admission to complete early enteral nutrition (EN) up to a calculated nutritional target.
