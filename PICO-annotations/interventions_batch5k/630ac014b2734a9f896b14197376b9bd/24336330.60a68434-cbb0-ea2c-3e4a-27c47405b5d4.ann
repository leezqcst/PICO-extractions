T1	Intervention 598 933	Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values.
T2	Intervention 1722 1839	Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored.
