[Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy as treatment of endometrial cancer].

AIM This study compares the effects of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy versus those of abdominal lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer.
METHODS A prospective randomized study was performed among 80 patients randomly assigned to laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and to abdominal lymphadenectomy in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared for 1 year of follow-up.
RESULTS Forty patients were assigned to laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and 40 patients to abdominal lymphadenectomy. The laparoscopic approach was associated with a longer operative time (234.1 min vs 137.3 min) but was less painful (VAS 5.3 vs 7.9; P<0.000) and resulted in a shorter hospital stay (4.4+/-1 vs 7.9+/-1.2 days; P<0.000). At 6 weeks the quality of life was better in patients who had laparoscopic lymphadenectomy (SF-12).
CONCLUSION Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy was associated with a significantly lower rate of major and minor postoperative complications and a better short term quality of life.
