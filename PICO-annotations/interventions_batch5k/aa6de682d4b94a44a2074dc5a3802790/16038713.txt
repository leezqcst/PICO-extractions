Superior efficacy of clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid compared with extended-release dipyridamole plus acetylsalicylic acid in preventing arterial thrombogenesis in healthy volunteers.

INTRODUCTION Recent ex vivo platelet aggregometry data indicate that clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75 mg/day is a more potent antiplatelet regimen than the marketed combination of dipyridamole+ASA. The present study was designed to assess the antithrombotic effect of both dual antiplatelet regimens using a human ex vivo model of arterial thrombosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. During two 10-day treatment periods separated by a 14-day washout period, 23 healthy male volunteers received once-daily clopidogrel 75 mg plus acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg, or twice-daily extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg plus acetylsalicylic acid 25 mg. Assessments were made at baseline and on Day 10 of each period. Arterial thrombus formation was induced ex vivo by exposing a collagen-coated surface in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber to native blood for 3 min (arterial wall shear rate 2600 s(-1)). Total platelet and fibrin deposition was determined by immunoenzymatic methods.
RESULTS Compared with baseline values, the mean inhibition of total platelet deposition was 63.9+/-5.9% with clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid, compared with 18.4+/-5.6% for extended-release dipyridamole plus acetylsalicylic acid (67% reduction; 95% CI, 49-79%; p<0.0001). Corresponding figures for fibrin deposition were 64.9+/-4.8% and 18.3+/-9.7%, respectively (58% reduction; 95% CI, 45-67%; p<0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid showed significantly superior antithrombotic efficacy compared with extended-release dipyridamole plus acetylsalicylic acid in preventing arterial thrombogenesis in humans.
