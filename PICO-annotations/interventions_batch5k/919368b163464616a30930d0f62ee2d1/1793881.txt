Midazolam as a main anesthesia induction agent--a comparison with thiopental and diazepam.

A clinical randomized investigation was undertaken to determine the value of midazolam as a narcotic adjuvant for anesthetic induction. Thirty ASA I-II adult patients undergoing selective surgery were allocated randomly into two groups to receive one of the following agents: midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, thiopental 5 mg/kg, or diazepam 0.4 mg/kg. The induction time as measured from the onset of injection to loss of the eyelash reflex was shortest in the case of thiopental; while a lower frequency of apnea, lesser suppression of circulation, and lack of venous irritation were points favoring midazolam. However, further study is needed to clarify the moderate cardiovascular response seen during intubation in some cases as well as to elucidate any patient population differences.
