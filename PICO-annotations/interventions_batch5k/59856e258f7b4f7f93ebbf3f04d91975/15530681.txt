Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination as a model to assess C-reactive protein response to mild inflammation.

This study was set up to examine whether an influenza vaccine or an influenza vaccine in combination with pneumococcal vaccine can be used as a model to study responses to mild stimulation of the inflammatory system. In this study, 19 subjects received the influenza vaccine, 20 subjects the combination of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. CRP and prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 (F1+2) were measured at baseline, and two times after vaccination. Influenza vaccination increased CRP by 0.20 mg/L, and influenza in combination with pneumococcal vaccine increased CRP by 0.60 mg/L. F1+2 increased 0.15 nmol/L after the combined vaccination; an increase in response to the influenza vaccination was not statistically significant. Our findings show that the influenza vaccine alone as well as the combination of the influenza and pneumococcal vaccine increases CRP-levels with a peak 2 days after vaccination.
