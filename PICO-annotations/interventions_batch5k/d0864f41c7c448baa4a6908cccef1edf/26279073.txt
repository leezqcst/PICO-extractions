Chromium Supplementation and the Effects on Metabolic Status in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of chromium intake on markers of insulin metabolism and lipid profiles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 64 women with PCOS were randomized to receive 200 µg chromium picolinate supplements (n = 32) or placebo (n = 32) for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and 8 weeks after the intervention to quantify markers of insulin metabolism and lipid concentrations.
RESULTS Chromium supplementation in women with PCOS resulted in significant decreases in serum insulin levels (-3.6 ± 7.4 vs. +3.6 ± 6.2 µIU/ml, p < 0.001), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; -0.8 ± 1.6 vs. +0.9 ± 1.5, p < 0.001), homeostatic model assessment-beta cell function (HOMA-B; -15.5 ± 32.3 vs. +13.6 ± 23.1, p < 0.001), and a significant increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) score (+0.02 ± 0.03 vs. -0.008 ± 0.02, p = 0.001) compared with the placebo. In addition, a trend toward a significant effect of chromium supplementation on decreasing serum triglycerides (-12.4 ± 74.4 vs. +15.2 ± 32.4 mg/dl, p = 0.05), very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-2.5 ± 14.9 vs. +3.0 ± 6.5 mg/dl, p = 0.05), and cholesterol concentrations (-8.6 ± 21.9 vs. +0.7 ± 22.4 mg/dl, p = 0.09) was seen.
CONCLUSIONS Eight weeks of chromium supplementation among PCOS women had favorable effects on markers of insulin metabolism.
