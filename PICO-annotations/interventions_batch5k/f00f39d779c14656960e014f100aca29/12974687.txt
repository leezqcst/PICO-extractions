Abrasive wear on eroded root dentine after different periods of exposure to saliva in situ.

The effect of salivary exposure time on the abrasive wear of acid-eroded dentine was evaluated in situ. One-hundred and twenty bovine root dentine slabs were randomly assigned into six groups (A-F) and placed in intraoral palatal devices, which were worn by 10 volunteers for 4 d. On the first day, no erosive/abrasive procedures were carried out. On the following 3 d, erosive challenges were performed extraorally, two times per day, by immersing the device for 90 s in a soft drink. Subsequently, the group A specimens were immediately brushed (40 strokes), and the others were brushed after the following times: B, 20 min; C, 40 min; and D, 60 min. Group E specimens were only acid-eroded and those of group F were only brushed. Dentine wear was measured with a profilometer. anova and Dunnett's test showed that groups A-D did not differ statistically from the control group E but differed from the control group F. The lowest mean value was found for group F. Regression analysis was unable to show salivary effect on dentine wear reduction. The data suggest that the exposure time of saliva of up to 60 min has no effect on reducing the eroded dentine wear by toothbrushing.
