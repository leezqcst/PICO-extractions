Final analysis of the UKLG LY02 trial comparing 6-8 cycles of CHOP with 3 cycles of CHOP followed by a BEAM autograft in patients <65 years with poor prognosis histologically aggressive NHL.

This trial involved 457 patients and sought to assess the value of early intensification with autologous transplantation in patients with poor prognosis histologically aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) showing a response to initial CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy. Randomization was made at the time of diagnosis with 223 assigned to continuing CHOP and 234 to 3 cycles of CHOP followed by a BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) autograft. Analysis was on an intention to treat basis. After the initial three cycles of CHOP 19% of the whole group were in complete response (CR) and 53% in partial remission (PR). At the end of treatment 86% of patients in the CHOP arm had responded with 58% in CR. In the high-dose therapy arm the overall response rate was 83% with 64% in CR (difference between arms not significant). The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival at 5 years for the continuing CHOP arm were 38% and 50% respectively, and for the autograft arm were 44% and 50% (differences not significant). Of the patients who attained CR and subsequently relapsed, there were no long-term survivors in the autograft recipients compared to 46% of the continuing CHOP recipients (P = 0.0008). In conclusion, no survival benefit was demonstrated for an early autograft in first response.
