Comparison of outcome of labetalol or hydralazine therapy during hypertension in pregnancy in very low birth weight infants.

Ninety-seven women with moderate to severe preeclampsia (PE) were allocated at random to labetalol or hydralazine treatment. Of these, 22 women with severe PE gave birth to neonates with VLBW (very low birth weight < or = 1500 g). Seven were allocated to labetalol treatment (Group A), eight to hydralazine treatment (Group B) and seven women received both drugs due to poor blood pressure control with a single drug therapy (Group C). No difference in cesarean section rate or in the indication for operative delivery could be seen. Gestational age was 29.9 weeks (25.4-32.5) in Group A, 28.6 weeks (26.6-33.4) in Group B and 27.3 weeks (26.7-31.1) in Group C (median and range). Birth weight did not differ between groups and 13 of the 22 infants weighed below 1000 g. There was a tendency to lower Apgar scores at five minutes in the hydralazine group. Time spent in the neonatal intensive care unit did not differ between groups. Five of the 11 neonates with gestational age (GA) < or = 28 weeks and three of the seven neonates in GA 29-30 weeks died. Neither the number of infants requiring intermittent positive pressure ventilation or duration of O2- treatment, nor number of infants with respiratory distress syndrome differed between groups. We did not find any difference in the outcome of the VLBW infants when the hypertensive mother had been treated with either hydralazine or labetalol.
