Removal of inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin by veno-venous continuous renal replacement therapy for burned patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of veno-venous continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on the plasma levels of endotoxin and cytokines in severely burned patients with sepsis.
METHODS Twenty adult severely burned patients with sepsis were studied. For the diagnosis of sepsis, patients were randomly divided into CRRT (n=10) and Control (n=10). Both groups received conventional therapy after admission. Veno-venous CRRT was administered to 10 patients in the CRRT group whenever patients were determined to be septic. The plasma level of endotoxin, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 36 and 60 h after CRRT initiation, and at 0, 12, 36 and 60 h after the patients were diagnosed as having sepsis in the Control group.
MAIN RESULTS Plasma level of endotoxin and all the cytokines after CRRT initiation were significantly lower than those before the treatment (P<0.01). The serial change of endotoxin, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 was significantly lower at 12, 36 and 60 h after treatment compared with Control groups (P<0.01). A significant decrease in plasma TNF-alpha levels was seen at 36 and 60 h after treatment compared with Control groups (P<0.01).
CONCLUSION Plasma endotoxin and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8) can be removed effectively with CRRT in severely burned patients with sepsis.
