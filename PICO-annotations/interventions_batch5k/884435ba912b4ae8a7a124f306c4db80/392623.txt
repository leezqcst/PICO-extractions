Controlled trial of induction of labor by vaginal suppositories containing prostaglandin E2.

A group of 84 women at 39-43 weeks of pregnancy were randomly allocated to a blind trial of induction of labor with vaginal suppositories containing inert material or either 0.2 mg or 0.4 mg of prostaglandin E2. The suppositories were self-administered every two hours during waking hours on two successive days until labor started or 15 had been used. Side-effects were absent. Labor was established within 48 hr of insertion of the first suppository in 9.3% of control patients, 65.4% of those treated with 0.2 mg PGE2 and 85.7% of those treated with 0.4 mg PGE2. The mean Apgar scores in the three groups were the same. The mean total dose of PGE2 were 2.0 mg (0.2 mg group) and 2.3 mg (0.4 mg group). It is concluded that vaginal PGE2 is an effective and acceptable method of inducing labor at term.
