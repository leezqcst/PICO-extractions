Befriending as an intervention for chronic depression among women in an inner city. 2: Role of fresh-start experiences and baseline psychosocial factors in remission from depression.

BACKGROUND Volunteer befriending promoted remission of chronic depression when clinical and other treatment variables were controlled.
AIMS To examine the role of other psychosocial factors relevant for outcome.
METHOD Factors measured at baseline interview were examined in multivariate analyses along with psychosocial factors occurring during follow-up, such as 'fresh-start' experiences and new severe events and difficulties.
RESULTS Fresh-start experiences and a standard attachment style were found to enhance chances of remission, with new severe stressors and markedly poor coping strategies liable to prevent it, with volunteer befriending continuing to play a role.
CONCLUSIONS The positive result reported in the preceding paper is unlikely to be an artefact. However, fresh-start experiences, absence of new severe stressors and standard attachment style were more important predictors of remission. This knowledge might profitably be incorporated into the evaluation of existing treatments.
