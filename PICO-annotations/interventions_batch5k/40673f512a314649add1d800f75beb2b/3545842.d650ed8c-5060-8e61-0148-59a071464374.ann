T1	Intervention 261 950	The aim of this trial was, to compare the efficacy of two doses of UK administered via a catheter in the pulmonary artery: 2000 IU kg-1 h-1 for 24 hours (UK 2000) in conjunction with heparin versus 4400 IU kg-1 h-1 UK alone for 12 hours (UK 4400) followed by heparin. PE was less than 5 days old and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by pulmonary angiograms demonstrating a vascular obstruction of more than 30% (Miller's index greater than 11). The efficacy of treatment was evaluated by the degree of early revascularization (pulmonary angiograms were performed 30 to 48 hours after initiation of thrombolytic treatment and analysed blindly by four independent vascular radiologists).
