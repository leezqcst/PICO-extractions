Etomidate with or without flumazenil anesthesia for stem cell transplantation in autistic children.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate etomidate administration with or without flumazenil in autistic children who underwent intrathecal transplantation of stem cells by lumbar puncture.
METHODS Forty autistic children aged 2-12, who were scheduled for stem cell transplantation via lumbar puncture under anesthesia, were randomized for a double-blind study. The children were randomly assigned to two groups: the flumazenil group (group F, n=20) and the etomidate group (group E, n=20). All children received 0.2 mg/kg of etomidate. In the case of inadequate anesthesia, patients received repeated doses of 0.1 mg/kg of etomidate until reaching deep sedation. After operation, children in group F were given flumazenil (0.01 mg/kg) and children in group E received placebo. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, the Ramsay sedation score (RSS), and recovery time of all children were continuously monitored and recorded during the entire procedure.
RESULTS After anesthesia, blood pressure and HR measurements were not significantly changed in both groups compared with the baseline. There were no respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. Five patients complained of pain on the site of injection. Myoclonus occurred in seven patients. Recovery time in group F was significantly shorter than in group E (p<0.001), and after the injection of flumazenil, RSS in group F significantly decreased than in group E. There were no significant differences in operation time. Physician satisfaction in both groups was similar.
CONCLUSIONS Etomidate resulted in stable hemodynamic responses and relatively less adverse effects, and flumazenil antagonized the anesthetic effect of etomidate; thus, etomidate with flumazenil is suitable for performing stem cell transplantation in autistic children.
