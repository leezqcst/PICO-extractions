Neuropsychological effects of risperidone in children with pervasive developmental disorders: a blinded discontinuation study.

OBJECTIVE Little is known about the neuropsychological effects of risperidone in children with pervasive developmental disorders.
METHOD Twenty-four children (aged 5-17 years) with pervasive developmental disorders and co-morbid disruptive behavior who responded favorably to open-label treatment with risperidone as part of a previously described controlled discontinuation study completed two different computerized attention tasks at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 24 of open-label treatment, and, at 8 weeks after random assignment to either placebo or risperidone. The primary efficacy measures were response latencies to visually presented stimuli requiring two different types of attention-controlled processing, i.e., focused and divided attention.
RESULTS About half of the clinical responders did not produce valid performance measures. These could be shown to be of younger mental age and less adaptive as measured by the Vineland Behavior Scales. For the valid task performers divided attention (serial search in working memory) was shown to regress in the placebo group (n = 7), while in the risperidone group (n = 7) there was further improvement. No such group difference was found for focused attention.
CONCLUSIONS The study suggests a beneficial effect of risperidone after several months of treatment, enhancing divided attention in children with pervasive developmental disorders.
