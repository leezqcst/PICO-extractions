Validation of a novel satisfaction questionnaire for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving outpatient clinical nurse specialist care, inpatient care, or day patient team care.

OBJECTIVES To develop and validate a questionnaire for measuring satisfaction with different forms of complex multidisciplinary care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS The satisfaction questionnaire (score range 0-100) comprised 28 items covering 11 domains. Together with a visual analog scale (VAS, range 0-100) on overall satisfaction, the questionnaire was applied in 210 RA patients who participated in a randomized trial comparing 3 types of multidisciplinary care.
RESULTS The questionnaire was returned by 174 patients (83%). The questionnaire and VAS scores in the total group were 75 (SD 12) and 83 (SD 20), respectively. Reliability analysis showed Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was 0.91. Spearman's correlation coefficient between the satisfaction questionnaire score and VAS score was 0.58 (P < 0.01). Mean total satisfaction questionnaire scores were 72 (SD 9), 76 (SD 14), and 78 (SD 11), in the nurse specialist, inpatient and day patient groups, respectively (nurse specialist versus day patient, P = 0.004). Significant differences between nurse specialist and day patients were seen in the following domains: waiting time during the treatment, autonomy, coordination, non-financial access, and quality of general information (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION Overall, patients were highly satisfied with the multidisciplinary care they received. Major differences regarding the organization of care were reflected in the results of the questionnaire scores. The satisfaction questionnaire appears to be a useful instrument for measuring satisfaction with complex multidisciplinary care in RA patients.
