Icosapent Ethyl (Eicosapentaenoic Acid Ethyl Ester): Effects Upon High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and Lipid Parameters in Patients With Metabolic Syndrome.

BACKGROUND The aim of this analysis was to examine the effects of icosapent ethyl (eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, IPE) on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and lipid parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome, with and without stable statin therapy.
METHODS This post hoc exploratory analysis evaluated patients with metabolic syndrome treated with IPE 4 grams/day, IPE 2 grams/day, or placebo in phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled studies entitled: MARINE [triglyceride (TG) levels ≥500 and ≤2000 mg/dL] and ANCHOR [TG levels ≥200 and <500 mg/dL, despite low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control with stable statin therapy].
RESULTS Compared with placebo in patients with metabolic syndrome in MARINE (n=204) and ANCHOR (n=645), at the approved dose of 4 grams/day, IPE significantly lowered hsCRP levels 40.0% (P=0.0007) in MARINE and 23.0% (P=0.0003) in ANCHOR. Compared with placebo in MARINE, which included patients with and without statin therapy, IPE 4 grams/day significantly reduced hsCRP levels 78.0% in statin-treated patients (P=0.0035, n=16). Compared with placebo in MARINE, IPE 4 grams/day significantly reduced TG levels (35.0%; P<0.0001), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C; 19.9%; P<0.0001), and apolipoprotein B levels (ApoB) (9.1%; P=0.0015) without raising LDL-C levels. Compared with placebo in ANCHOR, IPE 4 grams/day significantly reduced TG (21.7%; P<0.0001), non-HDL-C (13.5%; P<0.0001), ApoB (8.8%; P<0.0001), LDL-C (5.2%; P=0.0236), and HDL-C levels (4.0%; P=0.0053).
CONCLUSIONS Compared with placebo, IPE 4 grams/day significantly lowered hsCRP levels and improved lipids without raising LDL-C levels in patients with metabolic syndrome and high (≥200 and <500 mg/dL) or very high (≥500 and ≤2000 mg/dL) TG levels, with or without stable statin therapy.
