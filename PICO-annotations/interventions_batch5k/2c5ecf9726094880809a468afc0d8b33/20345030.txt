[Observation of curative effect on fixed-point spin reduction of spinal manipulation therapy for cervical vertigo].

OBJECTIVE To explore the role of fixed-point spin reduction of spinal manipulation therapy in the treatment of cervical vertigo and its effect on cervical artery spasm index (RI) and atlantoaxial displacement index (ADI).
METHODS From January 2002 to May 2008, 168 patients with cervical vertigo were randomly divided into treatment group (84 cases) and the control group (84 cases), 22 males and 62 females in treatment group; 24 males and 60 females in control group. The patients of treatment group and control group were respectively treated with fixed-point spin reduction of spinal manipulation therapy and dialectical prescription. The score of symptoms and signs, RI, ADI were observed and compared between two groups.
RESULTS The score of symptoms and signs markedly decreased after treatment, in treatment group: vertigo had (2.75 +/- 1.01) scores, neck-shoulder pain (1.58 +/- 0.36), headache (0.39 +/- 0.09), nausea-vomiting (1.58 +/- 1.30), ear noises (0.48 +/- 0.32), positive neck rotation test (0.59 +/- 0.21); and in control group: vertigo had (5.68 +/- 2.02) scores,neck-shoulder pain (3.12 +/- 1.82), headache (1.86 +/- 0.65), nausea-vomiting (3.25 +/- 0.69), ear noises (1.64 +/- 0.61), positive neck rotation test (1.79 +/- 0.67). Cervical artery spasm index and atlantoaxial displacement index had been significantly improved, cervical artery spasm index was respectively 0.54 +/- 0.07 and 0.52 +/- 0.13, atlantoaxial displacement index was respectively 2.92 +/- 0.82 and 4.50 +/- 1.32 between treatment group and control group.
CONCLUSION Fixed-point spin reduction of spinal manipulation therapy for cervical vertigo can accurately correct single or multiple vertebral body displacement, restore normal spinal position, reduce the oppression and stimulus of the vertebral artery, release ischemia of vestibular labyrinth, eliminate symptoms of vertigo.
