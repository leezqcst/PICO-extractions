Effects of the cholinomimetic SDZ ENS-163 on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in humans.

Scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment was used in healthy men to evaluate the central nervous system activity of the new cholinomimetic SDZ ENS-163. Eighteen subjects were treated in a crossover design with oral placebo/intravenous saline, 50 mg of oral SDZ ENS-163/intravenous saline, oral placebo/0.4 mg of intravenous scopolamine, and 50 mg of oral SDZ ENS-163/0.4 mg of intravenous scopolamine. The administration of placebo with scopolamine caused significant cognitive impairment, as assessed by the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB), and also decreased salivation and heart rate. In contrast, SDZ ENS-163 with saline had no effect on CNTB scores, increased salivation, and increased heart rate. Despite the observed cholinomimetic effects of SDZ ENS-163 when administered with saline, the changes in CNTB scores, heart rate, and salivation were indistinguishable between placebo/scopolamine and SDZ ENS-163/scopolamine. Thus, 50 mg of oral SDZ ENS-163 has cholinomimetic activity in normal men, but this dose is insufficient to reverse the muscarinic effects of 0.4 mg of intravenous scopolamine.
