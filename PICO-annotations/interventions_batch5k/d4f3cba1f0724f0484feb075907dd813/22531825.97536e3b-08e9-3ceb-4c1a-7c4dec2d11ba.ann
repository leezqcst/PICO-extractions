T1	Intervention 28 69	haptic decomposition of complex movements
T2	Intervention 701 799	elbow flexion/extension and the unified shoulder motion independently ("anatomical" decomposition)
T3	Intervention 804 909	three component shoulder motions in Euler coordinates and elbow flexion/extension ("Euler" decomposition)
T4	Intervention 921 1040	motion of the tip of the elbow and motion of the hand with respect to the elbow, independently ("visual" decomposition)
T5	Intervention 1044 1197	control group practiced the same number of movements, but experienced the target motion only, achieving eight times more direct practice with this motion
