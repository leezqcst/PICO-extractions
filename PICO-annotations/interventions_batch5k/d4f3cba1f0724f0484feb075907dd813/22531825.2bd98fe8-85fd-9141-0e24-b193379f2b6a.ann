T1	Intervention 35 107	decomposition of complex movements aids in robot-assisted motor learning
T2	Intervention 110 139	Training with haptic guidance
T3	Intervention 272 295	guidance-based training
T4	Intervention 340 464	complex movement, similar to a tennis backhand, into simpler parts and then using haptic feedback from a robotic exoskeleton
T5	Intervention 651 1040	target arm movement broken down in three ways: 1) elbow flexion/extension and the unified shoulder motion independently ("anatomical" decomposition), 2) three component shoulder motions in Euler coordinates and elbow flexion/extension ("Euler" decomposition), or 3) the motion of the tip of the elbow and motion of the hand with respect to the elbow, independently ("visual" decomposition)
T6	Intervention 1087 1136	movements, but experienced the target motion only
T7	Intervention 1245 1260	, part training
T8	Intervention 1406 1444	simpler, anatomically-isolated motions
T9	Intervention 1357 1382	robotic movement training
