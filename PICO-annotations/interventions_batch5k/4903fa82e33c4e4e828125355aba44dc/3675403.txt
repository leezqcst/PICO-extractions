A randomised comparison of three drainage systems following cholecystectomy.

The efficacy of low pressure, high pressure and passive drainage systems have been compared after cholecystectomy. Symptoms of pain, discomfort and nausea were compared using linear analogue scales and spirometry was used to examine pre-operative and postoperative respiratory function. The low pressure suction drain removed an intraperitoneal marker, gentamicin, more effectively than the high pressure suction drain, but not more effectively than the passive drain. There were no differences in postoperative respiratory function nor in the amount of pain or discomfort between the groups. The passive drain group reported less nausea than the suction drain groups. If a negative pressure drainage system is to be used, a low pressure suction drain should be used in preference to a high pressure system.
