[Comparison of three analgesic methods for postoperative pain relief and their effects on plasma interleukin-6 concentration following radical surgery for gastric carcinoma].

OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of preemptive epidural analgesia combined with postoperative epidural analgesia, postoperative epidural analgesia alone and intravenous analgesia for postoperative pain relief and their effects on plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration following radical surgery for gastric carcinoma.
METHODS Sixty-six patients with gastric carcinoma scheduled for gastrectomy were randomly divided into 3 groups, namely group P (n=22), group E (n=22) and group V (n=22), to receive preemptive epidural analgesia combined with postoperative epidural analgesia, exclusive postoperative epidural analgesia, and exclusive postoperative intravenous analgesia, respectively. Hemodynamic data were recorded for all the patients during the operation, and visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain intensity at 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h after surgery. Plasma IL-6 concentration was determined before surgery and at 24, 48, 72 h after surgery.
RESULTS No significant changes occurred in the hemodynamics during the preoperative periods. VAS and IL-6 were lower in group P than in group E and V, and group E had lower measurement than group V (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION Preemptive epidural analgesia combined with postoperative epidural analgesia provides more satisfactory pain relief and more effectively prevents IL-6 increment than exclusive epidural analgesia or intravenous analgesia after gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma.
