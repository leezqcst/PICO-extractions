T1	Intervention 112 618	The effects of desensitizer, disinfectant, saliva, blood, and hydrogen peroxide on the tensile bond strength between adhesive and ceramic as well as between adhesive and dentin were examined. Sixty 7x3 mm pressed ceramic discs of IPS e.max were fabricated and randomly assigned to six groups of different dentin surface treatments (control, desensitizer, disinfectant, saliva, blood, and hydrogen peroxide). Representative samples of fractured specimens were observed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy).
