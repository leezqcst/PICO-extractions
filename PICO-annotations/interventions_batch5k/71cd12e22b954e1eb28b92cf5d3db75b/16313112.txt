[Clinical study of feiyanqing rectum condensed liquid in treating 36 cases of children syncytial viral pneumonia].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical efficacy and mechanism of Feiyangqin Rectum Condensed Liquid (FRCL) in treating children syncytial viral pneumonia. Methods Seventy-two patients were randomly divided into two groups, the 36 patients in the treated group were treated with FRCL, and the other 36 patients in the control group simply treated with Western medicine. Efficacy of treatment on clinical condition and some immune function (IgA, IgG, CD3, CD4) were observed.
RESULTS In the treated group, 28 patients were cured (77.8%), treatment was markedly effective in 4 patients (11.1%), effective in 2 (5.5%) and ineffective in 2 (5.6%), with the total effective rate of 94.4%. The corresponding number in the control group was 20 (55.6%), 7 (19.4%), 6 (16.7%), 3 (8.3%) and 91.7%, respectively. The cure rate in the treated group was obviously superior to that in the control group (P < 0.05). FRCL could improve serum IgA, IgG, CD3, CD4, and CD4/CD8, lower serum IgE, these indexes in the treated group were significantly different to those in the control group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION FRCL had the action in treating children syncytial viral pneumonia without any adverse reaction, one of its mechanisms might be related to its regulation on immune function.
