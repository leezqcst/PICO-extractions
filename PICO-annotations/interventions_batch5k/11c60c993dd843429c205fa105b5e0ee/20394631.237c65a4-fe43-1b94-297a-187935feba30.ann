T1	Intervention 131 408;409 595;596 944	Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease and can pose a substantial therapeutic challenge. Recently, several phototherapeutic modalities, most notably pulsed-dye laser (PDL) treatment, have been introduced, but the published results - albeit promising - are controversial. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy of an adjuvant PDL treatment when combined with a proven topical treatment [fixed-combination clindamycin 1%-benzoyl peroxide 5% hydrating gel (C/BPO)]. METHODS Eighty patients (38 males and 42 females, mean +/- SD age 19.7 +/- 5.9 years) were randomized in a 1 : 2 ratio to receive C/BPO alone or in combination with PDL treatment (wavelength 585 nm, energy fluence 3 J cm(-2), pulse duration 0.35 ms, spot size 7 mm). Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks after initial treatment.
