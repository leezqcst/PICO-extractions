T1	Intervention 145 844	We conducted a randomized trial comparing bed rest with tocolysis to determine the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of tocolysis for the treatment of preterm labor after membrane rupture. One hundred nine women participated over a 26-month interval. Treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of gestational age at membrane rupture, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, maternal or fetal infectious morbidity, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, or perinatal mortality. Prolongation of intrauterine time after the onset of uterine contractions was seen in women receiving tocolysis (105.2 +/- 157 hours versus 62.1 +/- 77 hours, p = 0.06).
