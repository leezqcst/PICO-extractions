A web-based approach to address cardiovascular risks in managers: results of a randomized trial.

OBJECTIVES To examine whether a Web-based health and leadership development program--designed specifically for managers--was associated with changes in self-reported and biometric indicators of cardiovascular disease within the context of a randomized control trial.
METHODS A total of 145 managers from 8 organizations participated in a 6-month Internet-based program or a control condition. They completed pre- and posttest assessments that included both self-reported attitudes (on diet, exercise, and mental health) and biometric measures (eg, body weight, waist circumference).
RESULTS The intervention was associated with improvements in dietary attitudes, dietary self-efficacy, and exercise, and reductions in distress symptoms. Women in the program reduced their waist circumference significantly more than controls.
CONCLUSIONS The program showed promise for reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors. Similar results across diverse organizations suggest the program may be useful across industry types.
