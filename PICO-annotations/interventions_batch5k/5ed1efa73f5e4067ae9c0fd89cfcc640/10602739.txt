Ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, or levofloxacin as treatment for chronic osteomyelitis.

The efficacy and safety of three oral fluoroquinolones (lomefloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients had documented infections with quinolone-sensitive organisms and received either lomefloxacin, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. Levofloxacin was effective therapy for 9 of 15 (60%) patients. Lomefloxacin was effective therapy for five of seven (71%) patients, and ciprofloxacin was effective therapy for two of five patients (40%). Average follow-up was 11.8 months for patients who completed the course of therapy, and the average duration of therapy was 60.6 days. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from 18 patients, and 11 patients were cured. Oral fluoroquinolones can be safe, effective therapy if they are given for a prolonged course as treatment for infections caused by susceptible gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms and in combination with adequate surgical debridement.
