The effects of haloperidol on learning and behavior in autistic children.

The effects of haloperidol on behavioral symptoms and learning were critically assessed in autistic children in an ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Children were randomly assigned to haloperidol-placebo-haloperidol or placebo-haloperidol-placebo treatment sequences. Statistically, haloperidol was significantly superior to placebo in reducing behavioral symptoms. In discrimination learning paradigm, children receiving haloperidol learned the discrimination while those on placebo did not. Discrimination attained on haloperidol was retained when the children were switched to placebo.
