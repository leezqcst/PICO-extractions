T1	Intervention 88 255	applied external flow resistive (R) and elastic (E) mechanical loads over the entire respiratory cycle to five normal subjects by using a pseudorandom loading protocol
T2	Intervention 257 576	Loads ranged in magnitude from imperceptible (R0/E0) through just perceptible (R1/E1) to large (R2/E2) and resulted in respiratory pattern responses that were due to reflex responses alone (R0/E0) or to a combination of reflex responses and behavioral reactions to the perception of impeded breathing (R1/E1 and R2/E2).
