Intestinal absorption of dietary fat in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Fat absorption was studied in 24 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis and in 36 healthy control subjects. Beta-carotene and vitamin A in their plasma were also measured. This double-blind and randomized study showed no differences between these two populations with regard to the three parameters. We did not find evidence for fat malabsorption in multiple sclerosis.
