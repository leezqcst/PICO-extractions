T1	Intervention 226 255	pseudorandom loading protocol
T2	Intervention 257 575	Loads ranged in magnitude from imperceptible (R0/E0) through just perceptible (R1/E1) to large (R2/E2) and resulted in respiratory pattern responses that were due to reflex responses alone (R0/E0) or to a combination of reflex responses and behavioral reactions to the perception of impeded breathing (R1/E1 and R2/E2)
T3	Intervention 629 712	computed impulse responses of tidal volume and inspiratory and expiratory durations
