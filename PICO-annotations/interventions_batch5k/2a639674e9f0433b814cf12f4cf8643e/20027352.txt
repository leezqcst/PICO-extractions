Efficiency of anaferon in complex therapy of genital herpes.

We studied clinical efficiency and IFN-inducing activity of anaferon in chronic recurrent genital herpes with high incidence of relapses. The use of anaferon in complex therapy reduced the duration of intoxication symptoms and local symptoms, shortened the duration of the relapse, activated expression of IFN-gamma mRNA, and improved IFN-gamma-producing capacity of blood leukocytes.
