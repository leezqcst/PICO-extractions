[Triple therapy regimens involving H2 blockaders for therapy of Helicobacter pylori infections].

Comparison of ranitidine and lansoprazole in short-term low-dose triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two 1-week low-dose triple-therapy drug regimens involving antisecretory drugs for Helicobacter pylori infection, 99 patients with H. pylori infection were treated with either lansoprazole (LPZ) or ranitidine (RNT) used together with clarithromycin (CAM) and metrinidazole (MTZ). The drug combination and administration periods in the PPI group were LPZ 30 mg, CAM 400 mg, MTZ 500 mg (LCM group). The ranitidine group received RNT 300 mg, CAM 400 mg, MTZ 500 mg (RCM group). The cure rate of H. pylori infection was 88% in the LCM group; 95% CI 79-97 and 92% in the RCM group; 95% CI 84-99.
