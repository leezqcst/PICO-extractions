Effect of a multi-faceted intervention on gingival health among adults with systemic sclerosis.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of adaptive oral hygiene devices and orofacial exercise to improve gingival health among adults with systemic sclerosis (SSc).
METHODS Forty-eight patients with SSc were assigned randomly to the multifaceted oral health intervention or usual dental care control group. Participants in the intervention group received a rechargeable, powered Oral-B® oscillating-rotating-pulsating toothbrush and a Reach® Access™ Flosser that has a toothbrush-like handle. For those with an oral aperture of less than 40 mm, orofacial exercises were taught. Participants in the control group were each given a manual toothbrush and dental floss. Participants in both groups received instructions and demonstration on the use of the devices, and were requested to perform the respective intervention twice a day for 6 months. Evaluations were at baseline, 3-, and 6-months. The main outcome was gingival index (GI), an indicator of gingival inflammation.
RESULTS Both groups showed significant reduction in GI scores at 6 months (ps<0.005). Reduction in GI scores of the intervention group at 6 months was 20.8% which is considered to be clinically significant. Compared to the control group, the intervention group showed a significant and larger reduction in GI score by 8% at 6 months (p=0.0007).
CONCLUSIONS Results support the use of adaptive devices and orofacial exercise to improve gingival health in adults with SSc when compared to use of manual toothbrushing and finger-held flossing. Recommending and educating patients with SSc to use adaptive devices to clean the tooth surfaces looks promising for long-term oral health improvement.
