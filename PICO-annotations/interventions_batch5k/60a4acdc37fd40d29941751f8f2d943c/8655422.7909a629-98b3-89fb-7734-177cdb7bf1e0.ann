T1	Intervention 420 827	A total of 168 Holstein steers (182.7 +/- 27.5 kg) were used in a completely randomized design experiment (eight treatments; three pens of seven steers/treatment). Steers were given ad libitum access to high-concentrate diets (13% CP) containing 71% whole shelled corn, 10% corn silage, 4% condensed distillers solubles, and 15% protein supplements (DM basis). Treatments were arranged as a 2 x 4 factorial.
