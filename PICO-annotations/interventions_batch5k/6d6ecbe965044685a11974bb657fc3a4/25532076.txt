Cariprazine in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar I disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial.

BACKGROUND This Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of flexibly-dosed cariprazine in patients with acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
METHODS Patients were randomized to 3 weeks of double-blind treatment with cariprazine 3-12mg/day (n=158) or placebo (n=154). The primary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to Week 3 in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. The secondary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to Week 3 in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score.
RESULTS Mean change from baseline to Week 3 in YMRS total score was significantly greater for patients receiving cariprazine 3-12mg/day versus placebo (P=0.0004). Significant differences between groups in YMRS total score mean change were observed by Day 4 (first postbaseline assessment) and maintained throughout double-blind treatment (all assessments, P<0.01). Cariprazine also demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on YMRS response (≥50% improvement: cariprazine, 58.9%; placebo, 44.1%; P=0.0097) and remission (YMRS total score≤12: cariprazine, 51.9%; placebo, 34.9%; P=0.0025) and mean change in CGI-S (P=0.0027) score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (P=0.0035) total score. The most common cariprazine-related (≥10% and twice placebo) treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyspepsia, and vomiting. Mean change from baseline in metabolic parameters were generally small and similar between groups.
LIMITATIONS Lack of active comparator arm; short duration of study.
CONCLUSION In this study, cariprazine 3-12mg/day was effective and generally well tolerated in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
