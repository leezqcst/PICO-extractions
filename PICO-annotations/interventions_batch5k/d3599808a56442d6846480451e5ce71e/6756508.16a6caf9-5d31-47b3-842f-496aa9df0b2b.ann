T1	Intervention 149 728	Eighty-eight postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, in whom estrogen receptors (ER) were positive or unknown, were treated on a controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of tamoxifen and to assess the therapeutic advantage of sequentially adding low-dose cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy in tamoxifen responders. Patients with known ER negative status were not studied. After the initial 12-week treatment with tamoxifen alone, 60% of ER positive patients achieved complete or partial response as did 35% in whom ER were unknown.
