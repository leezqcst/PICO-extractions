Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET): implications for reduced cardiovascular risk.

The recently published Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes, as the largest published comparative trial of these agent classes, provides further evidence concerning the comparison between the angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). In this trial, telmisartan (an ARB) was non-inferior to ramipril (an ACEI) in reducing fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Moreover, ONTARGET is an example of a high-quality noninferiority trial. However, the combination of the 2 agents was associated with more adverse effects without an increase in benefit. The study differed from several other comparative studies in which the dose and choice of ACEI was left to individual physicians. Further, in ONTARGET, the ACEI was not titrated to the maximum dose and patients with heart failure were excluded.
