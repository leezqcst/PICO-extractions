Role of warm saline mouth rinse in prevention of alveolar osteitis: a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND The present study was aimed at determining the role warm saline rinse in the prevention of alveolar osteitis following dental extractions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Apparently patients aged 16 and above who were referred to the Oral Surgery Clinic of our institution, with an indication for non-surgical extraction of pathologic teeth were prospectively and uniformly randomized into warm saline group and control. The experimental group (n = 80) were instructed to gargle 6 times daily with warm saline and no such instructions were given to the second group (n = 80) to serve as controls. Information on demographic, indications for extraction, and development of alveolar osteitis were obtained and analyzed. Comparative statistics were done using Pearson's chi square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS The demographic and other baseline parameters such as indications for extractions were comparable among the study groups (p > 0.05). The overall prevalence of alveolar osteitis was 13.7%. There was a statistical significant difference between the study groups with respect to development of alveolar osteitis (X2 = 15.00, df = 1, p = 0.001).The risk of development of alveolar osteitis was 4 times higher in the control group (OR = 4.33, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION Warm saline mouth rinse instruction is beneficial in the prevention of development of alveolar osteitis after dental extractions.
