Effect of low-intensity back exercise on quality of life and back extensor strength in patients with osteoporosis: a randomized controlled trial.

UNLABELLED Randomized controlled study in 80 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was conducted to investigate the effect of a home-based, simple, low-intensity exercise. Low-intensity back-strengthening exercise was effective in improving the quality of life and back extensor strength.
INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Back-strengthening exercise is effective in increasing back extensor strength and decreasing risk of vertebral fractures. We hypothesized that a home-based, simple, low-intensity exercise could enhance back extensor strength and improve the quality of life and/or spinal range of motion in postmenopausal women in a short-term follow-up.
METHODS Eighty postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 38) or an exercise group (n = 42). Subjects were instructed to lift their upper trunk from a prone position antigravity and maintain the neutral position. Isometric back extensor strength, spinal range of motion, and scores for quality of life were evaluated at baseline and 4 months.
RESULTS Back extensor strength significantly increased both in the exercise group (26%) and in the control group (11%). Scores for quality of life increased in the exercise group (7%), whereas it remained unchanged in the control group (0%). There was a significant difference in quality of life score between the groups (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS Low-intensity back-strengthening exercise was effective in improving the quality of life and back extensor strength in patients with osteoporosis.
