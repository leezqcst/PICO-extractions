Endoscopic versus operative gastrostomy: final results of a prospective randomized trial.

This study compared operative gastrostomy (OG) (by surgeons) with endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) (by physicians) in a prospective randomized fashion to determine whether one technique was superior. PEG (Sachs-Vine) and OG (Stamm) were done using local anesthesia. Patients were assessed for complications, mortality, tube function, and cost. Groups were equally matched for indications and underlying disease. Fifty-seven had OG and 64 had attempted PEG. Complications occurred in 26% of OG patients and 9% died. Complications occurred in 25% of PEG patients and 12% died. Tube feeding was initiated in both groups within a mean of 29 (24 to 72) hours of the gastrostomy placement. OG cost $1675 and PEG $979 to perform. Twenty-one PEG patients required endoscopic tube change which raised their total cost to $1574. We conclude there is no difference between OG (using local anesthesia) and PEG with regard to morbidity, mortality, or tube function. The endoscopic technique does appear to have economic advantage.
