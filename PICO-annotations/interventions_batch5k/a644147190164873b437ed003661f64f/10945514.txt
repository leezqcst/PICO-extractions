Combination hydrocodone and ibuprofen versus combination codeine and acetaminophen for the treatment of chronic pain.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of combination hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg with that of combination codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg for the treatment of chronic pain.
BACKGROUND Hydrocodone 7.5 mg with ibuprofen 200 mg is the only approved fixed-dose combination analgesic containing an opioid and ibuprofen.
METHODS In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, repeated-dose, active-comparator, 4-week, multicenter study, 469 patients were randomly assigned to receive a 1-tablet (n = 156) or 2-tablet (n = 153) dose of combination hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg (HI1 and HI2, respectively) or a 2-tablet dose of combination codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg (CA, n = 160), the active comparator, every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. Efficacy was measured through pain relief scores, number of daily doses of study medication, number of daily doses of supplemental analgesics, number of patients who discontinued therapy due to an unsatisfactory analgesic response, and global assessment scores.
RESULTS Of the 469 patients, 255 (54.4%) were female and 214 (45.6%) were male. The mean age was 51.1 years. Types of chronic pain included back (214; 45.6%), arthritic (145; 30.9%), other musculoskeletal (65; 13.9%), cancer (6; 1.3%), diabetic neuropathic (3; 0.6%), postherpetic neuralgic (5; 1.1%), other neurologic (21; 4.5%), and other unclassified chronic pain (10; 2.1%). During the 48 hours prior to the study, 351 (74.8%) patients had been treated with opioid or opioid-nonopioid combination analgesics. The overall mean daily pain relief score was significantly greater in the HI2 group (2.25+/-0.89) than in the HI1 group (1.98+/-0.87) (P = 0.003) or the CA group (1.85+/-0.96) (P < 0.001). The overall mean number of daily doses of study medication was significantly less in the HI2 group (2.94+/-0.99) than in the HI1 group (3.23+/-0.76) (P = 0.036) or the CA group (3.26+/-0.75) (P = 0.014). The overall mean number of daily doses of supplemental analgesics was significantly less in the HI2 group (0.24+/-0.49) than in the HI1 group (0.34+/-0.58) (P = 0.021) or CA group (0.49+/-0.85) (P = 0.010). The number of patients who discontinued treatment due to an unsatisfactory analgesic response was significantly less in the HI2 group (2; 1.3%) than in the CA group (12; 7.5%) (P = 0.008). HI2 was more effective than HI1 and CA as measured by pain relief scores for week 1 (P < 0.001 vs HI1 and CA), week 2 (P < 0.001 vs HI1 and CA), and week 3 (P = 0.008 vs HI1 and P < 0.001 vs CA); daily doses of study medication for week 1 (P = 0.019 vs HI1 and P = 0.011 vs CA); daily doses of supplemental analgesics for week 1 (P = 0.010 vs HI1 and CA); and global assessment scores for week 1 (P = 0.018 vs HI1 and P < 0.001 vs CA), week 2 (P = 0.005 vs HI1 and P < 0.001 vs CA), and week 4 (P = 0.013 vs HI1 and P = 0.023 vs CA). There were no significant differences between HI1 and CA in any efficacy variable. There were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing adverse events in the HI2 (127; 83%), HI1 (124; 79.5%), and CA (129; 80.6%) groups. However, the mean number of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was significantly greater in the HI2 group (40; 26.1%) than in the HI1 group (23; 14.7%) (P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that 2-tablet doses of combination hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg may be more effective than either 1-tablet doses of this combination or 2-tablet doses of combination codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg. Moreover, 1-tablet doses of combination hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg may be as effective as 2-tablet doses of combination codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg.
