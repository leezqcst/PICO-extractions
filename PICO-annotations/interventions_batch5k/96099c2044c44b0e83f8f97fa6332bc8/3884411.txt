The treatment of senile dementia associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency: a comparative study of buflomedil and dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids.

Seventy-six patients took part in a randomized, comparative study of the efficacy of buflomedil hydrochloride and dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids in the treatment of senile dementia associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Efficacy was assessed by the patients' performance in four psychometric tests. The results showed that a trend in favour of the buflomedil group in three of the tests became statistically significant in the fourth. Both drugs appeared to be safe, causing no marked adverse reactions. In conclusion, buflomedil is as effective or more effective than dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids in the treatment of senile dementia associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency and could prove a valuable addition to long-term therapy if further studies support the trend shown in this study.
