The comparative safety and diagnostic accuracy of adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging in women versus men.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To determine if the diagnostic accuracy and safety of intravenous adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging is significantly different in men compared with women.
DESIGN Prospective, comparative, open-label clinical trial.
SETTING Nuclear medicine laboratory in a university-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS Consecutive patients who were referred for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease. Patients were judged not to be able to exercise adequately.
INTERVENTIONS Coronary angiography was conducted within 6 weeks of an adenosine thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging study.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Diagnostic accuracy is shown in the table. [table: see text] Overall, side effects from adenosine were not different between men and women. The frequencies of ST depression and chest pain were significantly greater in women than men, although their etiologies are unknown. The frequency of severe side effects such as heart block and hypotension was not different between men and women.
CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy and safety of adenosine thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging are generally similar in women and men.
