Use of Interceed(TC7) absorbable adhesion barrier to reduce postoperative adhesion reformation in infertility and endometriosis surgery. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Adhesion Prevention Committee.

Interceed(TC7) is a fabric composed of oxidized, regenerated cellulose that was designed to reduce the formation of postsurgical adhesions. We evaluated Interceed(TC7) in a randomized, multicenter clinical study. Sixty-three infertility patients had bilateral pelvic sidewall adhesions removed at laparotomy. One pelvic sidewall was covered by Interceed(TC7) and the other was left uncovered. The deperitonealized areas (N = 205) of all sidewalls were divided into three groups: less than 100 mm2, N = 72; 100-1000 mm2, N = 95; and more than 1000 mm2, N = 38. The effectiveness of Interceed(TC7) was evaluated at laparoscopy 10-98 days after laparotomy. Significantly more adhesions were observed at laparoscopy on the control pelvic sidewalls (48 of 63, 76%) than on the treated sides (26 of 63, 41%) (P less than .0001). The Interceed(TC7)-treated sidewalls also had significantly less area involved with adhesions at laparoscopy (P less than .05, P less than .001, and P less than .001 in the three groups, respectively). Twenty-eight women with severe endometriosis also had significantly more adhesions on the control side (23 of 28, 82%) than on the treated side (14 of 28, 50%) (P less than .05). We conclude that Interceed(TC7) effectively reduced the incidence and extent of postoperative adhesions, even in patients with severe endometriosis.
