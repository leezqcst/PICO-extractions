Effectiveness of education for gastric cancer patients: a controlled prospective trial comparing interactive vs. lecture-based programs.

OBJECTIVE Although patient education may enhance knowledge, coping with illness, and quality of life among cancer patients, it is uncertain which didactic method is most effective. We compared the impact of an interactive, patient-oriented group program to a lecture-based, information-only program in gastric cancer patients.
METHODS In this prospective, controlled trial, 121 gastric cancer patients attending inpatient rehabilitation after surgical treatment received either the interactive intervention or lectures providing information. The outcomes were patients' disease-related knowledge, active coping with illness, and quality of life (QoL) at the end of their stay and 6 and 12 months thereafter.
RESULTS Both groups improved their knowledge and QoL during rehabilitation; however, knowledge was significantly higher in the interactive group compared to the lecture group. This difference was maintained at the 6- and 12-months follow-ups. In addition, the interactive group proved superior to the lecture group regarding active coping with illness and QoL at the end of rehabilitation, but not during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS A structured, interactive patient education program proved superior to lecture-based provision of information in regards to short-term and long-term knowledge as well as short-term coping and QoL.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS In gastric cancer patients, interactive patient education seems preferable over lectures.
