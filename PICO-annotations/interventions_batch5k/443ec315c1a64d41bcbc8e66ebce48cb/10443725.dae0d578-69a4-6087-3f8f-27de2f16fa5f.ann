T1	Intervention 297 850	One hundred twenty-one men with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) underwent a pressure-flow study (PFS) at 1 of 11 clinical centers. The PFS technique was standardized, and all tracings were read by a single reader unaware of the treatment group. Patients who were obstructed according to a modified Abrams-Griffiths nomogram were randomized to 5 mg finasteride (n = 81) or placebo (n = 40) for 12 months; all patients continuing into an open extension received finasteride during the second 12 months of therapy
