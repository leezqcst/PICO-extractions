T1	Intervention 714 2128	Four of the 10 CAHB patients received combined prednisolone/interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) therapy. Peripheral blood samples were consecutively collected for analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations using an indirect immunofluorescence (IF) method, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was quantified by a chemiluminescent, molecular-hybridization assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seven Chinese control individuals comprised 63 +/- 3% CD3+ cells, of which 41 +/- 4% were of CD4+ and 23 +/- 2% of CD8+ subsets. The mean CD4/CD8 ratio in the healthy controls was 1.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.7). The CD4/CD8 ratios were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) in the 10 patients with chronic hepatitis B, compared with those of the controls, owing to a significant increase in the number of CD8+ cells (P < 0.005). During the treatment with prednisolone, a significant increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio was observed in all treated patients. This increase was mainly caused by a decrease in the number of CD8+ cells and was accompanied by an increase in serum HBV DNA levels, which peaked during the latter part of the prednisolone cycle. During the treatment with IFN-alpha2b, a second increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio was observed, which was caused by an increase in CD4+ cells. A marked decrease in viral load was observed, during treatment with IFN-alpha2b, in patients with HBV DNA levels below 10 000 pg ml-1.
