T1	Intervention 1401 2223	In individual subjects, the baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were nonnormally distributed. We therefore used a nonparametric technique to calculate the net trough-to-peak ratios from the results in individual subjects. In the morning, these ratios averaged 0.25 systolic (95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.41) and 0.15 diastolic (95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.31) and in the evening, 0.19 and 0.36 (95% confidence intervals, 0.00 to 0.38 and 0.14 to 0.56), respectively. When the blood pressure profiles were smoothed by substituting the 1-hour averages by moving or fixed 2-hour averages or by Fourier modeling, the trough-to-peak ratios remained unchanged after the morning dose (0.20/0.13, 0.20/0.14, and 0.16/0.21, respectively) but tended to increase in the evening (0.32/0.38, 0.28/0.40, and 0.48/0.49).
