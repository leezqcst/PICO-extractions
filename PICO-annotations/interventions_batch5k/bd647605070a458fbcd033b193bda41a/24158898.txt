Sequential therapy versus standard triple-drug therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication: a randomized study.

BACKGROUND Antimicrobial resistance has decreased eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori infection worldwide. A sequential treatment schedule has been reported to be effective, but studies published to date were performed in Italy. We undertook this study to determine whether these results could be replicated in India.
METHODS A randomized, open-labeled, prospective controlled trial comparing sequential vs. standard triple-drug therapy was carried out at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Mumbai. Two hundred and thirty-one patients with dyspepsia were randomized to a 10-day sequential regimen (40 mg of pantoprazole, 1 g of amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for the first 5 days, followed by 40 mg of pantoprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 500 mg of tinidazole, each administered twice daily for the remaining 5 days) or to standard 14-day therapy (40 mg of pantoprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 1 g of amoxicillin, each administered twice daily).
RESULTS The eradication rate achieved with the sequential regimen was significantly greater than that obtained with the triple therapy. Per-protocol eradication rate of sequential therapy was 92.4% (95% CI 85.8-96.1%) vs. 81.8% (95% CI 73.9-87.8%) (p = 0.027) for standard drug therapy. Intention-to-treat eradication rates were 88.2% (95% CI 80.9-93.0%) vs. 79.1% (95% CI 71.1-85.4%), p = 0.029, respectively. The incidence of major and minor side effects between therapy groups was not significantly different (14.6% in the triple therapy group vs. 23.5% in sequential group, p = 0.12). Follow up was incomplete in 3.3% and 4.7% patients in standard and sequential therapy groups, respectively. Sequential therapy includes one additional antibiotic (tinidazole) that is not contained in standard therapy.
CONCLUSIONS Sequential therapy was significantly better than standard therapy for eradicating H. pylori infection.
