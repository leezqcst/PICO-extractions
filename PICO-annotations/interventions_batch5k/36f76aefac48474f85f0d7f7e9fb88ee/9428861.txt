Postoperative analgesia by D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-trisphosphate in patients undergoing cholecystectomy.

UNLABELLED D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-trisphosphate (1,2,6-IP3) possesses antiinflammatory properties, such as reduced eicosanoid synthesis and inhibition of inflammation-induced edema. These properties suggest possible analgesic effects. The analgesic effect of 1,2,6-IP3 was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized study in 24 patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Ten patients received 1,2,6-IP3 as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus dose of 240 mg, followed by a continuous i.v. infusion at 90 mg/h for 24 h. The placebo group (n = 14) received corresponding volumes of isotonic saline. Postoperative pain (visual analog pain scale; VAS) and opiate analgesic requirements (ketobemidon) were evaluated during five postoperative days. Results showed significantly reduced pain during the first five postoperative days in patients treated with 1,2,6-IP3, as measured by using a VAS (P < 0.05). The requirements of opioid analgesics were significantly reduced during the first three postoperative days (P < 0.05). No drug-related side effects were observed. Results of the present study demonstrate a potent and long-lasting analgesic effect of 1,2,6-IP3, possibly related to its antiinflammatory properties.
IMPLICATIONS A new antiinflammatory drug under investigation, inositol-1,2,6-trisphosphate, was evaluated as a possible analgesic in a pilot study during the postoperative period in cholecystectomized patients. Results showed significantly lower pain assessment and opioid consumption, which should encourage further studies.
