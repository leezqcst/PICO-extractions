[Using gaviscon preparation for relief of esophageal, extraesophageal syndromes and functional dyspepsia in elderly patients with GERD].

OBJECTIVE To compare the clinical efficacy of alginate drug Geviskon and aluminum-magnesium antacids to relieve symptoms of esophageal, extraesophageal syndrome and functional dyspepsia at 3 and 7 days of study in patients with GERD elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS An open, longitudinal, randomized, parallel-group. The study included 60 patients with "A" degree of ERD, consistently received in-patient treatment in the Municipal KGVV, mean age 79.0 +/- 6.8 years. During the first 12 hours of hospital stay by "sealed envelopes" them randomly divided into equal groups of comparison, given 3 times a day: alginate product--Geviskon forte dose of 10 ml and aluminum-magnesium antacid drug at a dose of 1 sachet. Assess the frequency and severity of esophageal symptoms, extraesophageal syndrome, functional dyspepsia at 3 and 7 days of study on 5-point scale Likert. The degree of esophageal mucosal injury was determined during endoscopy before the study.
RESULTS The technique of alginate compared with antacids provided significantly more complete and earlier effect on the relief of heartburn, regurgitation, chronic cough, sore throat, and EBS. Only Geviskon influenced the symptoms of PPD in patients with GERD.
CONCLUSION The clinical features Geviskon the frequency and timing of relief of symptoms of esophageal, extraesophageal syndrome, functional dyspepsia with GERD in the older age groups is higher than that of antacids. Suspension Geviskon may be recommended in patients with middle and old age as an effective and safe symptomatic funds in the first days of exchange rate earlier generations of PPI therapy, as well as monotherapy--to maintain remission.
