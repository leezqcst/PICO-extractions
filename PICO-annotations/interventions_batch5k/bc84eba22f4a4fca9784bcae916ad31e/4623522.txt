The effect of phenytoin on the absorption of synthetic folic acid polyglutamate.

The absorption of synthetic pteroyltriglutamate has been measured in nine normal students with and without the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin. It has been shown that phenytoin has no effect on the absorption of this folate polyglutamate. The reasons are discussed for the disparity between this result and those reported in the literature when folate polyglutamates derived from yeast were used.
