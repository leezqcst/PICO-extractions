Behavior in children with Down syndrome.

OBJECTIVE To highlight the differences in behaviors in children with diagnosis of Down syndrome.
METHOD Eight children with Down syndrome who displayed autistic features were compared with eight Down syndrome children without autistic features. These children were randomly selected and were matched for age and level of retardation. Standardized Psychological tests were administered to tap the behavioral differences. Mann-Whitney U test was used for significance of difference between both the groups.
RESULTS Down syndrome children without Autism Spectrum Disorder had better communication and socialization skills than children with Down syndrome with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Down syndrome children with Autism Spectrum Disorder displayed more restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors, interests and activities.
CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that Autism Spectrum Disorder manifests as a distinct behavioral phenomenon in Down syndrome. Hence it is important for professionals to consider the possibility of a dual diagnosis which will entitle the child to a more specialized and effective educational and intervention services.
