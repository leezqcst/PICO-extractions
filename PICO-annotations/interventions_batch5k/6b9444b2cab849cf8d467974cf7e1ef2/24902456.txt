Evaluation of postprocedure cognitive function using 3 distinct standard sedation regimens for endoscopic procedures.

The primary purpose of this investigation was to evaluate postprocedure cognitive function associated with 3 distinct standard sedation regimens used for endoscopic procedures. A secondary aim was to identify complications requiring provider interventions. Subjects scheduled for colonoscopies were approached for enrollment the day of their procedure. A convenience sample of 96 subjects was randomly assigned. Cognitive function was recorded on the day of surgery using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 24 and 48 hours postoperatively using the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS). The propofol plus fentanyl group had a mean TICS score of 34.53 at 24 hours compared with 34.96 at 48 hours (P = .017). The midazolam plus fentanyl group had a mean TICS score of 34.76 at 24 hours compared with 36.26 at 48 hours (P = .004). The propofol-alone group had a mean TICS score of 35.09 at 24 hours compared with 35.98 at 48 hours (P = .924). The results of this investigation indicate that the sedation regimen of propofol alone has the least impact on postprocedure cognitive function. Additionally, the number of jaw lift interventions was significantly higher in both groups who received fentanyl.
