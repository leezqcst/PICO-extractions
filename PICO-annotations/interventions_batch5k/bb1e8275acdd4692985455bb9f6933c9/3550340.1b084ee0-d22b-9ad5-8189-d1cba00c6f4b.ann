T1	Intervention 400 1064	Eighty-three patients with advanced disease were entered into the first study (43/chemotherapy; 40/control), and 60 into the second (27/chemotherapy; 33/control). Patient randomization was stratified by stage (III/IV) and site (oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, paranasal sinuses). The first study utilized bleomycin, Cytoxan, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in two cycles (one cycle if no tumor response), followed by standard treatment which consisted of combined irradiation and surgery or, in some instances, primary irradiation alone. The second study utilized cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in three cycles prior to standard treatment.
