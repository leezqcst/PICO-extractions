MR imaging of pituitary region lesions with gadodiamide injection.

Twelve patients with known or suspected pituitary lesions underwent MR imaging with gadodiamide injection at a dose of 0.1 (n = 5) or 0.3 (n = 7) mM/kg. Six of the patients were also studied with 0.1 mM/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine. Consistent with previous reports gadodiamide injection was found to be a safe and effective contrast medium for MR imaging of the pituitary region. No additional diagnostic information was obtained using 0.3 mM/kg gadodiamide injection compared to 0.1 mM/kg gadopentate dimeglumine in the same patients. The high dose (0.3 mM/kg) gadodiamide injection in 7 patients did not shorten the T2 value sufficiently to overwhelm the T1 shortening and leave pathologic lesions hypointense compared to precontrast studies. With the comparable relaxivities of gadodiamide injection and gadopentetate dimeglumine, similarities in results have to be expected when using these media for MR image enhancement.
