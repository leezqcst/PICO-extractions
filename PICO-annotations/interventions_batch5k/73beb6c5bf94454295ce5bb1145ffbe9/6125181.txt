The influence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on left ventricular function.

1 This study was designed to compare in a randomized cross-over trial pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker lacking sympathomimetic activity in hypertensives with incipient heart failure. Cardiac function was investigated by M-Mode and 2D-echo-cardiography. 2 Both pindolol and metoprolol in equipotent doses lowered blood pressure to the same extent. 3 There was no difference in overall left ventricular function in ventricular geometry or in wall dynamics after either drug. 4 In comparison to metoprolol, pindolol produced less reduction in resting heart rate, cardiac index and ejection velocity reflecting the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of the drug.
