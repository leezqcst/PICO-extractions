Parenteral amino acid and metabolic acidosis in premature infants.

BACKGROUND Aggressive parenteral nutrition (PN) including amino acids is recommended for low-birth-weight infants to prevent energy and protein deficit. Their impact on acid-base homeostasis has not been examined.
METHODS We investigated the impact of dose and duration of parenteral amino acids, with cysteine, on acid-base parameters in 122 low-birth-weight infants. Premature infants <or=32 weeks, <or=1850 g, and receiving parenteral amino acids at 1.5 g/kg/d for an extended period (>24 hours), or 3 g/kg/d for a short (5 hour), extended (24 hour), or prolonged (3-5 days) duration were included in the study. Data were obtained at age 0-3 days (n = 43) or, when clinically stable, age 3-5 days (n = 49). Data from 30 infants, matched for birth weight and gestational age, receiving PN during the first 5 days after birth were also obtained. Acidosis was defined as pH <7.25.
RESULTS Acidosis was evident in all infants between 2 and 5 days after birth. Infants with large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exhibited significantly (p < .05) lower pH early, had higher blood urea nitrogen levels (26 +/- 9 vs 18 + 8 mg/dL; p < .05), and had greater weight loss ( approximately 17% of birth weight) when compared with infants without PDA. Gestational age, weight loss, and patent ductus arteriosus accounted for 65% of variance in acidosis.
CONCLUSIONS Low-birth-weight infants develop metabolic acidosis between 2 and 5 days after birth, irrespective of dose and duration of parenteral amino acid administration. Careful management of parenteral fluids and comorbidities may lower the incidence of acidosis and promote protein accretion.
