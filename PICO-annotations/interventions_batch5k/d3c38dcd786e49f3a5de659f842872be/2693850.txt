Dacarbazine versus dacarbazine-vindesine in disseminated malignant melanoma: a randomized phase II study.

In a phase II study 119 patients with disseminated malignant melanoma were randomized to receive treatment with dacarbazine alone or in combination with vindesine. The study was designed to reveal an additive response rate when the drugs were combined. Dacarbazine was given i.v. at 250 mg m-2 per day X V every 4 weeks. In the combination regimen vindesine given at 3 mg m-2 per week was included. One hundred and ten patients were available for evaluation of response. With dacarbazine 4/51 patients obtained a complete remission (8%) and 5/51 patients a partial remission (10%). Overall response rate was 18%. With dacarbazine-vindesine 8/59 patients obtained a complete remission (13%) and 7/59 patients a partial remission (12%). Overall response rate was 25%. The difference in response rates observed between the treatment arms is not statistically significant. Median response duration was 123 days for dacarbazine patients and 171 days for patients receiving dacarbazine-vindesine (difference not statistically significant).
