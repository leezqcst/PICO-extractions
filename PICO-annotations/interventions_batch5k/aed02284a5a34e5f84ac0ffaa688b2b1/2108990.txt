The effect of HCG supplementation after combined GnRH agonist/HMG treatment in an IVF programme.

The necessity of luteal-phase supplementation in an IVF programme is of continuing interest. After ovarian stimulation with clomiphene and human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), the beneficial effect of supporting the luteal phase has never been scientifically demonstrated. After ovarian stimulation with GnRH agonist/HMG, the luteal phase seems to be inadequate, but in a previous study we did not find evidence to support the need for oral progesterone supplementation. To evaluate the beneficial effect of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) supplementation, we performed a multicentre, double-blind, randomized study with HCG (193 transfers) against placebo (194 transfers). The ongoing pregnancy rate per transfer cycle was significantly better with HCG (18.7 versus 9.3). This is the first truly objective (randomized) study demonstrating the beneficial effect of supporting the luteal phase in an IVF programme.
