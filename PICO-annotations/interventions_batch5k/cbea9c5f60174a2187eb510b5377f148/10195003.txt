A comparison of a non-ionic dimer, iodixanol with a non-ionic monomer, iohexol in low dose intravenous urography.

A prospective, double-blind study of 392 patients randomized into four groups was performed to establish whether diagnostic intravenous urograms could be obtained with a lower dose of iodine when using the dimeric, non-ionic contrast medium iodixanol compared with the monomeric, non-ionic iohexol. Patients received iodixanol or iohexol containing either 9 or 12 g of iodine (gI). The primary parameter was the diagnostic quality of the 6 min film, assessed in a blinded fashion, by consensus, by four radiologists. Iodixanol at both doses was diagnostic in over 90% of cases. Iohexol was only diagnostic in 74% (9 gI) and 81.8% (12 gI). Pairwise comparisons revealed that iodixanol 9 gI was significantly better than both iohexol 9 gI (p = 0.0005) and 12 gI (p = 0.014). No significant difference was present for different doses within the same contrast medium group. Iodixanol resulted in poorer bladder distension than iohexol. Iodixanol caused significantly less discomfort than iohexol.
