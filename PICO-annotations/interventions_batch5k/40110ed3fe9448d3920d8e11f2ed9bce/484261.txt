A controlled study of early discharge after uncomplicated myocardial infarction.

Out of 383 myocardial infarction (MI) patients aged below 70 years, 252 (66%) were judged after the third day in hospital to have had uncomplicated infarctions. These patients were allocated at random to two groups, one of which was given treatment for 8 days and the other for 15 days. No significant differences in mortality, morbidity or incapacity for work could be detected during the three-month period of follow-up. The findings thus support previous conclusions that early discharge from hospital after uncomplicated MI is not associated with greater risk for the patient than later discharge.
