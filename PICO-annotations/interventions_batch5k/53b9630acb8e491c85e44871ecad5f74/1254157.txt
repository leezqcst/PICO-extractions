[The problems of prophylactic chemotherapy, the second-look operation and the maintenance of the remission in the treatment of ovarian cancer (author's transl)].

The results of the treatment of 1022 ovarian cancers were reviewed and the problems of prophylactic chemotherapy, a second look operation and the maintenance of the remission were studied. In ovarian cancers of stage 1 and stage 2, a post-operative prophylactic chemotherapy is useful only in cases with tumor cells in the secretions of the pouch of Douglas or in the ascites and in cases where a sensitivity to the chemotherapy can be assumed. In about 50% of primarily inoperable stage 3 ovarian cancers, the random treatment with cyclophosphamide (Endoxan) results in a clinical remission. A significant five year cure rate can only be obtained if the uterus and the adnexa are removed. Radical operation during the remission appears to be very important for survival of the patient. For the maintenance of the remission continuous chemotherapy for at least 2 years following treatment by operation and radiotherapy is necessary.
