Combination peel with incorporated fractional prickle coral calcium for the treatment of keratosis pilaris: a pilot study.

BACKGROUND Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a common condition of follicular plugging with variable erythema. There is a lack of reliable response to the treatment of KP.
OBJECTIVE We evaluated the effect and safety of combination peel with fractional prickle coral calcium (FCR™) in the treatment of KP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen Korean patients were treated with FCR™ on both upper arms for five sessions at 2-week intervals. Clinical evaluations, mexameter measurements, and assessment of patients' satisfaction and adverse events were performed at baseline and every visit.
RESULTS After treatments, statistically significant improvements in the baseline KP were observed in erythema and melanin index of mexameter on treated upper arms. Both the physicians' and patients' assessments correlate with the results of mexameter scores.
CONCLUSION Our results suggest FCR™ should be considered as an effective and safe treatment option for the patients with KP.
