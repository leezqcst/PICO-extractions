Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy versus abdominal hysterectomy in stage I endometrial cancer.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare laparoscopic treatment for stage I endometrial cancer with the traditional transabdominal approach. From July 1996 to July 1998, 61 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were treated at the Gynaecology Oncology Unit at the Royal North Shore of Sydney, Australia. Twenty-nine patients were treated with laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy (BSO) plus minus laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy (LPLA), while 32 patients were treated with the traditional laparotomy and underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and BSO plus minus pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA). The main outcomes studied were operative time, blood loss, blood transfusion, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, and number of lymph nodes obtained. In conclusion, laparoscopic treatment of endometrial cancer is safe in the hands of experienced operators with minimal intraoperative and postoperative complications. This procedure is associated with significantly less blood loss and shorter hospitalization; however, it is associated with significantly longer operating time. Proper selection of patients for the laparoscopic procedure is the vital step in achieving the major goals of this approach.
