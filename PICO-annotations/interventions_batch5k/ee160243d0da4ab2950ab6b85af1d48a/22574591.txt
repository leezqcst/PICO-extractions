[Effects of shuxuening injection on the levels of serum matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients].

OBJECTIVE To observe the effects of Shuxuening Injection (SI) on the levels of serum matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) in acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
METHODS Seventy-nine patients with acute exacerbated COPD were randomly assigned to the treatment group (39 cases) and the control group (40 cases). Routine therapies for COPD were given to patients in the control group, while 15 mL SI was given to those in the treatment group by intravenous dripping, twice daily for total 14 days. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were detected by Spirometer. The FEV1/FVC (%) and the FEV1% were calculated. The levels of serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were detected using ELISA before and after treatment, and compared with 20 healthy subjects as the control.
RESULTS The FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC (%), and FEV1% were significantly improved after treatment in the treatment group when compared with before treatment and with the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). When compared with before treatment and with the control group, the levels of serum MMP-9, TIMP-1, and the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 decreased more significantly in the treatment group after treatment (P < 0.01). Correlation analyses showed that obvious negative correlation existed between the levels of serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and FEV1/FVC (%) (r = -0.677, -0.629, P < 0.01). Obvious negative correlation existed between the levels of serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and FEV1% (r = -0.562, -0.661, P < 0.01). Furthermore, obvious negative correlation also existed between the ratio of MMP-9/ TIMP-1 and FEV1%, as well as FEV1/FVC (%) (r = -0.732, -0.891, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS SI could improve the pulmonary ventilation function of acute exacerbated COPD patients. One of its mechanisms might be correlated with lowering the serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, and correcting the imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1.
