[One-year effect of health counseling on life style and risk factors of heart disease].

INTRODUCTION We examined the need for counselling and the effect on willingness and ability to change life-style, and subsequent changes in risk factors for CHD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS All 152 male employees in a computer company, 25-45 years of age, were invited to participate in a controlled intervention study over one year. The subjects were randomised to an intervention group (I group) and a control group. The I group was divided into subgroups based on baseline behaviour and risk factor status. Changes were evaluated after one year. After an initial health examination, participants in the I group were counselled at baseline and at 5 months.
RESULTS Eighty-five (56%) men participated. Twenty-nine were assigned to a control group and 56 to an intervention group (I group) (dropouts = 8). An exercise group (E group) was advised to take up aerobics exercise three times/week, a diet group to reduce the intake of saturated fat and increase fish products, and smokers to stop smoking. Forty were recommended one or more behavioural changes and eight had no need. Thirty-four were willing to make behavioural changes. Compared to the control group, the fitness level increased (p < 0.01) and body weight decreased in the I group (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION Individual counselling promotes regular exercise with subsequent improvements in CHD risk factors. The diet and smoking counselling models were less successful in terms of compliance.
