Comparison on therapeutic effect of plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin for Guillian-Barre syndrome.

OBJECTIVES To observe and compare the clinical curative effect of the plasma exchange (PE) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS).
METHODS Overall, 64 adult patients with GBS for PE and IVIg treatment, respectively, and nerve function were observed pre-treatment and at 1 week/2 weeks after completion of treatment; the blood immunoglobulin, complement, fibrinogen (Fib) and monocyte percentage (MON%) were detected simultaneously.
RESULTS After PE treatment, nerve function defect appeared to improve better than the IVIg group and clinical effect was better than the IVIg group. Treatment effective rates of the two groups after 2 weeks, respectively, are 96 and 79%. PE and IVIg can significantly reduce the GBS patients' blood immunoglobulin IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4, but these were significantly lower in the PE group than in the IVIg group. Fib and MON% were significantly lower in the PE group than in the IVIg group.
CONCLUSION Both PE and IVIg have a high response as therapy and are reasonable therapeutic options for GBS. However, PE treatment has a more significantly curative effect, as it can effectively improve symptoms and be helpful in the early rehabilitation of patients.
