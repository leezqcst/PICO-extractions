Catheter-related infections via temporary vascular access catheters: a randomized prospective study.

Temporary vascular access catheters (VACs) are important devices used in acute blood purification therapies. The aim of this study was to determine whether a catheterization duration of 2 weeks increased the risk of nosocomial complications when compared with a 1-week duration. Fifty-six patients with 90 double lumen VACs were randomly chosen, and received either 1- or 2-week catheterizations from operators experienced in the placement of such catheters at three sites such as the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein. The characteristics of the VACs, including the sites, procedures, and lengths, were similar in both groups. No significant difference in the rate of catheter colonization was observed between the groups (14.6% vs 26.2%, P = 0.1371). No significant difference in the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections was observed between the groups (2.1% vs 4.8%, P = 0.5967). Two-week indwelling did not increase the risk of infection compared with 1-week indwelling at any of the sites in critically ill patients.
