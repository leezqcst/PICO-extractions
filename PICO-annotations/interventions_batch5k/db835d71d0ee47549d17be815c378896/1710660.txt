New hope for children with Kawasaki disease.

Kawasaki disease is now the most common cause of acquired heart disease in America's children. It is an acute febrile illness that may cause coronary artery aneurysm formation in infected children. The results of a multicenter, randomized trial on the effect of intravenous administration of gamma globulin (IVGG) plus aspirin versus aspirin alone upon coronary aneurysm formation show a decrease in coronary aneurysm formation from the usual 20%-30% to 3%. Administration of IVGG presents some unique challenges for nurses. Also, the pediatric nurse must educate parents and children about this disease to prepare them for discharge and long-term follow-up care.
