T1	Intervention 116 598	To characterize the time course of plasma and red blood cell (RBC) changes after n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation, 20 healthy male volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either four 1-g capsules of n-3 PUFA ethyl esters or four 1-g capsules of olive oil (as placebo) for a period of 4 mo, followed by a 3-mo washout period. Fatty acids of plasma and RBC phospholipid fractions were analyzed at 0, 2, and 4 mo of treatment and at 1, 2, and 3 mo of washout.
