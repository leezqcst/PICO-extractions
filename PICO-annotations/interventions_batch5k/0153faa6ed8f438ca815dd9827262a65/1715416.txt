[A randomized trial of PVB, VAB-6, BVP regimen versus PEB chemotherapy in patients with disseminated testicular tumors].

During 2 years and 7 months from June, 1985 to December, 1987, a randomized multi-center trial of PVB, VAB-6, BVP regimen (group A) without etoposide versus PEB chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatinum) (group B) was given to patients with disseminated testicular tumors. Of 34 patients registered, 10 patients were with minimal disease in stages IIA, IIIO and IIIA and 24 with extensive disease in IIB, IIIB2 and IIIC. Seminomas were found in 10 patients, while non-seminomatous tumors in 24. Among groups A and B, there was no statistical difference in clinicopathological profiles. A group patients were given either PVB, VAB-6 or BVP according to the physician's discretion. In groups A and B, 35% and 43% of the patients achieved complete response, and 45% and 50% achieved partial response, respectively. The difference in CR rates among both groups was not statistically significant even when calculated according to the stage or histologic grouping. Salvage treatments mainly with surgical resection of residual tumors after the chemotherapy, however, were more successful in group B (88%) than group A (61%). It appears likely that the higher response of induction chemotherapy in patients with extensive disease made the salvage surgery more successful in group B than in group A. The 3 year survival rate was 100% in group B, whereas it was 76% in group A. Although the incidence of myelosuppression and alopecia was significantly higher in group B, neuropathy was significantly more frequent in group A. From the above results, PEB seems to be a better induction chemotherapy than the conventional one for advanced testicular tumors.
