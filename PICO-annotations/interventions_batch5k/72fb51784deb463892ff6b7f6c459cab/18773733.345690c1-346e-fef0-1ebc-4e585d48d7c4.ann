T1	Intervention 58 78	Vibrotactile stimuli
T2	Intervention 0 35	Vibrotactile--auditory interactions
T3	Intervention 404 553	four different levels of auditory stimulation (no tone, tone at detection threshold, tone at 5 dB above threshold, and tone at 10 dB above threshold)
T4	Intervention 573 594	vibrotactile stimulus
T5	Intervention 702 828	In two further experiments, a 2-interval forced-choice procedure was used to assess the nature of this cross-modal interaction
