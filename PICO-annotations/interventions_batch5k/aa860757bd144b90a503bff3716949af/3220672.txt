Argon laser trabeculoplasty in primary open-angle glaucoma--results in black Jamaican population.

A controlled, randomised, prospective trial of Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) was carried out on 48 eyes of 30 black Jamaican patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. All eyes had uncontrolled intra-ocular pressures (greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg) despite medical therapy. Treatment was successful in controlling intraocular pressure in 68% of eyes after 12 months follow-up (p = 0.004). The average drop in intraocular pressure attributable to ALT was 6.6 mmHg. Argon laser trabeculoplasty is an effective adjunct in managing to control intraocular pressure in black Jamaican glaucoma patients.
