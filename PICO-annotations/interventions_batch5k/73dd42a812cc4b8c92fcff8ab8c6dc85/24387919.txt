Whole-body CT screening: scan delay and contrast injection duration for optimal enhancement of abdominal organs and deep vessels.

PURPOSE To assess the optimal scan delays and contrast injection durations for contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography (CT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred forty-two patients were randomized into three groups: protocol A-scan delay of 65 s after starting contrast injection over 30 s; protocol B-105 and 70 s; and protocol C-145 and 110 s, respectively. Contrast enhancement and diagnostic acceptability were assessed.
RESULTS Qualitative assessment was subtle among the three protocols. Homogenous enhancement of deep veins was more assuredly achieved with protocol C.
CONCLUSION With protocol C, qualitatively acceptable enhancement can be obtained in whole-body CT.
