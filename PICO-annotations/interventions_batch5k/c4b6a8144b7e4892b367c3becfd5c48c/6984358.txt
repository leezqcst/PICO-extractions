Tolfenamic acid and caffeine: a useful combination in migraine.

Tolfenamic acid is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, which has been proved effective in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. The usefulness of caffeine, metoclopramide and pyridoxine as adjuncts to tolfenamic acid was tested in acute migraine attacks in ten patients. A combination of tolfenamic acid (200 mg) with either caffeine (100 mg), metoclopramide (10 mg) or pyridoxine (300 mg) was given twice to each patient in random order. Thus 60 attacks were treated. The tolfenamic acid-caffeine combination proved the most effective as judged by duration and intensity of attacks, working ability, vigilance, and overall evaluation of the drugs by the patients. Metoclopramide was somewhat better than pyridoxine as an additive.
