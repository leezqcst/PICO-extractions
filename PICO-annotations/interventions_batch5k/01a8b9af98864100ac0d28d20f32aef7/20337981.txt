Effects of early enteral feeding on fecal elastase 1 and plasma secretin.

BACKGROUND Enteral feeding is known to be effective on the development of gut hormone secretion and pancreatic exocrine function. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of extremely early enteral feedings on the development in very low-birthweight (VLBW) infants.
METHODS Fecal elastase 1 and plasma secretin concentrations were measured at four different periods during the first 28 days of life in VLBW infants, with extremely early enteral feeding starting within 24 h of birth, as well as in control infants.
RESULTS Fecal concentrations of elastase 1 at 7, 14 and 28 days after birth were significantly higher than those at 1 or 2 days in both the early feeding and control groups. Fecal elastase 1 levels in the early feeding group were significantly higher than those in the control group at 7 and 14 days after birth. The plasma concentration of secretin at 14 days after birth was significantly higher than that at 1 or 2 days and 7 days after birth in the early feeding group. No significant differences in plasma secretin levels were detected between the early feeding and control groups at 1 or 2 days, 7 days and 28 days after birth, but a significant difference in secretin level was observed between the two groups at 14 days after birth.
CONCLUSIONS Extremely early enteral feedings may play an important role in the development of pancreatic exocrine function and secretin secretion in the early period of life in VLBW infants.
