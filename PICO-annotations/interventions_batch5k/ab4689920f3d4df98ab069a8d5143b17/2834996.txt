Intranasal recombinant alfa-2b interferon treatment of naturally occurring common colds.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with naturally occurring common colds of less than or equal to 48 h duration were randomly assigned to receive nasal sprays of recombinant alfa-2b interferon at 10 or 20 MU/day or placebo four times per day for 5 days. The 10-MU (n = 74), 20-MU (n = 74), and placebo (n = 72) groups had comparable frequencies of documented rhinovirus colds (50 to 65%) and mean durations of pretreatment symptoms (26 to 27 h). The median duration of colds tended to be longer in the 20-MU group (10 days) than the 10-MU group (8 days) or placebo group (8 days) (P = 0.06). In those with proven rhinovirus colds treated within 24 h, the median duration was significantly longer in the 20-MU group (9 days) than in the placebo group (6 days). No differences favoring interferon treatment were found in respiratory symptom scores or resolution of specific symptoms. On days 5 and 7, nasal washings from compliant subjects with proven rhinovirus colds yielded rhinoviruses more often in placebo (47 and 48%, respectively) than in interferon (15 and 16%, respectively) recipients (P less than 0.02), but no differences in new respiratory illness occurrence were observed in household contacts. Interferon recipients had significantly higher frequencies of blood in nasal mucus (16 to 18%) than did placebo recipients (4%) during treatment. Antibiotics for presumed secondary infections were given more often in the 20-MU group (11%) than in the placebo group (0%) (P less than 0.01). Nasal sprays of recombinant alfa-2b interferon were not an effective treatment for natural colds and were associated with toxicity.
