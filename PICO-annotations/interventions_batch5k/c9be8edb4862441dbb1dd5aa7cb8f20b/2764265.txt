[Preventive use of Pentaglobin in intensive care treatment of trauma patients].

Basing on 50 posttraumatic intensive-care patients with medium grade lesions (ISS criteria), the prophylactic effect of an intravenously applicable IgM preparation (Pentaglobin) against nosocomial infections was investigated. The prophylaxis group received on the 3rd, 4th and 5th day a daily dose of 10 g each. At the same times the controls were given 12.5 g human albumin each. Whereas no difference was seen between both groups regarding the definitive outcome of the treatment, the prophylaxis group clearly showed fewer infection pointers during the clinical course. In particular, the incidence and magnitude of febrile temperatures were significantly lower between the 4th and 8th days of treatment. Our results indicate, however, that the prophylactic use those patients who are at particularly high infection exposure risk, e.g. through reintervention surgery, haemorrhage complications or extensive diagnostic interventions.
