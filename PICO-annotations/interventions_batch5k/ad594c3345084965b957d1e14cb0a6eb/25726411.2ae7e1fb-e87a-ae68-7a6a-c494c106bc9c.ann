T1	Intervention 397 1037	Patients (men ≥ 45 years; women ≥ 50 years) with known or suspected coronary artery disease (n = 124) were randomized to 1 of 2 diagnostic sequences: rest and regadenoson SPECT on day 1, then regadenoson CTP and rest CTP (and coronary CT angiography [CTA]) (CTA; same acquisition) on day 2 or regadenoson CTP and rest CTP (and CTA) on Day 1, then rest and regadenoson SPECT on day 2. Scanning platforms included 64-, 128-, 256-, and 320-slice systems. The primary analysis examined the agreement rate between CTP and SPECT for detecting or excluding reversible ischemia in ≥ 2 myocardial segments as assessed by independent, blinded readers
