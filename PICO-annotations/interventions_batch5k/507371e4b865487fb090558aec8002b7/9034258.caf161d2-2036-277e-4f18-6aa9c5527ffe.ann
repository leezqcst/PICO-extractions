T1	Intervention 545 1110	Autologous technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled red blood cells and indium-oxine ((111)In)-labeled human serum albumin were injected intravenously during anesthesia at T = 0 min in the two groups for the determination of total blood volume and albumin diffusion space, respectively. In addition, body tetrapolar electrical impedance was used to assess extracellular fluid volume. In the hemodiluted group (group 2), 15 mL/kg of blood was withdrawn over 30 mins (T = 20 mins to T = 50 mins) and simultaneously replaced by an equal volume of 4% albumin solution (0.6 g/kg).
