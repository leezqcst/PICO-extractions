[Effect of dopexamine in splanchnic perfusion during surgery of the abdominal aorta].

Abdominal aortic surgery has significant effects on cardiac and splanchnic perfusion. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of dopexamine, an inodilator drug, on hemodynamic and splanchnic perfusion with measurement of gastric intramucosal pH, by the method of gastric tonometry, during abdominal aneurysm resection. Twenty-five patients undergoing excision of an aortic abdominal aneurysm were randomly divided into two groups. During aortic cross-clamping Group II patients received dopexamine infusion, at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/m, and at a dose of 0.5 micrograms/kg/m from declamping to the end of the surgery. Whereas Group I patients did not receive a dopexamine infusion. During aortic cross-clamping the intramucosal pH value decreased in Group I patients, but did not change in Group II patients. Heart rate, cardiac index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation increased significantly during dopexamine infusion, whereas systemic vascular resistance was reduced. During aortic cross-clamping dopexamine was a useful agent in improving splanchnic blood flow, cardiac index venous saturation. Also, since the drug produces dose related hemodynamic changes of rapid onset and reversibility, it is possible to interrupt the infusion before aortic declamping to avoid the decrease in the intramucosal pH value.
