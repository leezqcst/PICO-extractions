Micronized flavonoids in pain control after hemorrhoidectomy: a prospective randomized controlled study.

PURPOSE We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of micronized flavonoid fractions (MFF) on pain after hemorrhoidectomy.
METHODS The subjects were 112 consecutive patients randomly assigned either to receive MFF (group 1) for 1 week or not to receive MFF, as a control (group 2), after hemorrhoidectomy, The severity of pain and the number of intramuscular analgesic injections required were recorded for the first 3 days, then 1 week after hemorrhoidectomy. The number of days that intramuscular analgesic injections were required, hospital stay, and patient satisfaction were also assessed.
RESULTS On postoperative day (POD) 1, there were no significant differences between the parameters of the two groups, but on PODs 2 and 3, both the pain score ( P = 0.033 and P = 0.011, respectively) and the number of patients who required intramuscular analgesic injections were significantly less in group 1 ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.007, respectively). Moreover, the hospital stay was shorter and patient satisfaction was superior in group 1 ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). After 1 week, the pain score and number of intramuscular analgesic injections given were significantly less in group 1 ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.021).
CONCLUSION Using MFF after hemorrhoidectomy reduced the severity of pain and intramuscular analgesic requirement.
