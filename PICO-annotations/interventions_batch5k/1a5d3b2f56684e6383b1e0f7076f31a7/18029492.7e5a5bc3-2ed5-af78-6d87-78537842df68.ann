T1	Intervention 407 779	Trained men (n = 41; 34 +/- 5 y; maximum oxygen uptake = 55 +/- 7 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)) from a homogenous police Special Forces unit were randomly assigned in a double blind manner to either JPC (n = 21) or placebo (n = 20). We used multiple 7-d food records to assess dietary intake and found inadequate mean daily fruit and vegetable consumption (3.2 +/- 1.2 servings).
