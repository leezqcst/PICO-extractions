Intra-articular hyaluronic acid compared to intra-articular triamcinolone hexacetonide in inflammatory knee osteoarthritis.

The aim of this study was to determine the comparative efficacy and safety of intra-articular (i/a) triamcinolone. hexacetonide (TH) and i/a hyaluronic acid (HA) in inflammatory knee osteoarthritis. A randomized double-blind comparative trail was carried out in a rheumatology outpatient department. There were 63 patients (24 male, 39 female, mean age 70.5 years) with bilateral symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with effusion. Each was given five HA injections at weekly intervals; or 20 mg TH followed by four placebo (saline) injections. Patients were examined weekly during the treatment period and then at monthly intervals for a further 6 months. Assessment included recording of: visual analog scores (VAS) for pain; duration of stiffness; range of movement; joint effusion; local heat; synovial thickening; joint-line and periarticular tenderness. The principal outcome measure was pain on a self-selected activity assessed by Vas. The two groups were comparable at entry and no significant differences between the groups developed at any time during the treatment period. However, there was a high drop-out rate and intention to treat analysis failed to demonstrate statistically significant differences between the groups. In patients remaining in the study, significantly less pain was experienced by the HA group during the 6 month follow-up period. Other parameters showed a similar trend in favor of experienced by the HA group during the 6 month follow-up period. Other parameters showed a similar trend in favor of HA. We could not, however, demonstrate significant differences between the placebo and active treatments. HA may therefore be a useful additional therapy for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and may have a long duration of action.
