Evaluating proton stereotactic body radiotherapy to reduce chest wall dose in the treatment of lung cancer.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can produce excellent local control of several types of solid tumor; however, toxicity to nearby critical structures is a concern. We found previously that in SBRT for lung cancer, the chest wall (CW) volume receiving 20, 30, or 40Gy (V20, V30, or V40) was linked with the development of neuropathy. Here we sought to determine whether the dosimetric advantages of protons could produce lower CW doses than traditional photon-based SBRT. We searched an institutional database to identify patients treated with photon SBRT for lung cancer with tumors within < 2.5cm of the CW. We found 260 cases; of these, chronic grade â‰¥ 2 CW pain was identified in 23 patients. We then selected 10 representative patients from this group and generated proton SBRT treatment plans, using the identical dose of 50Gy in 4 fractions, and assessed potential differences in CW dose between the 2 plans. The proton SBRT plans reduced the CW doses at all dose levels measured. The median CW V20 was 364.0cm(3) and 160.0cm(3) (p < 0.0001), V30 was 144.6cm(3)vs 77.0cm(3) (p = 0.0012), V35 was 93.9cm(3)vs 57.9cm(3) (p = 0.005), V40 was 66.5cm(3)vs 45.4cm(3) (p = 0.0112), and mean lung dose was 5.9Gy vs 3.8Gy (p = 0.0001) for photons and protons, respectively. Coverage of the planning target volume (PTV) was comparable between the 2 sets of plans (96.4% for photons and 97% for protons). From a dosimetric standpoint, proton SBRT can achieve the same coverage of the PTV while significantly reducing the dose to the CW and lung relative to photon SBRT and therefore may be beneficial for the treatment of lesions closer to critical structures.
