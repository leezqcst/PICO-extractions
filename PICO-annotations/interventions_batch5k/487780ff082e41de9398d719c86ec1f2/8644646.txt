Comparative efficacy of intravenous ibutilide versus procainamide for enhancing termination of atrial flutter by atrial overdrive pacing.

This study compares the influence of intravenous ibutilide, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, with procainamide, a class IA antiarrhythmic agent, and with placebo on its ability to terminate atrial flutter using rapid atrial pacing. Fifty-nine episodes of atrial flutter in 54 patients who failed to terminate with an intravenous infusion of ibutilide, procainamide, or placebo alone underwent attempts at pacing termination using a standard protocol of burst atrial overdrive pacing. Atrial flutter cycle length and atrial monophasic action potential duration recorded from the right atrium during atrial flutter were measured at baseline and following infusion of ibutilide, procainamide, or placebo. Both ibutilide and procainamide significantly enhanced (p <0.001) pacing-induced termination of atrial flutter compared with placebo. Pacing converted 2 of 11 patients (18%) who received placebo, 13 of 15 patients (87%) who received ibutilide, and 29 of 33 patients (88%) who received procainamide to sinus rhythm. Ibutilide and procainamide compared with placebo markedly reduced (p <0.001) the incidence of pacing-induced atrial fibrillation. The atrial flutter cycle length was prolonged significantly less (p <0.001), and the atrial monophasic action potential duration was increased significantly more (p <0.001) by ibutilide than by procainamide. Although the electrophysiologic changes induced by these antiarrhythmic agents contributed to facilitating pacing-induced termination, neither tachycardia cycle length nor action potential duration were useful predictors of the ability of pacing to terminate atrial flutter. In conclusion, despite differing electrophysiologic effects, the use of intravenous ibutilide or procainamide enhances the termination of atrial flutter by atrial overdrive pacing.
