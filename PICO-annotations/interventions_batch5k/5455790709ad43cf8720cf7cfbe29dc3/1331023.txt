The adrenocorticotrophic hormone (4-9) analog ORG 2766 benefits autistic children: report on a second controlled clinical trial.

In a second controlled crossover trial, 20 autistic children received 40 mg/day of the neuropeptide ORG 2766, a synthetic analog of ACTH (4-9), for 8 weeks. Parents' checklist ratings (ABC) as well as clinicians' ratings (CGI) pointed to significant improvements after the course of treatment; improvements were clearest on the ABC social withdrawal subscale. The analysis of individual target symptoms and the parents' treatment preferences substantiated the beneficial effects of ORG 2766. In an ethologically analyzed playroom session, ORG 2766 treatment was associated with an improvement in the children's play behavior and a significant increase in the social interaction between child and experimenter. Gaze coordination between child and experimenter also was improved.
