A comparative study of ofloxacin and amoxycillin/clavulanate in hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections.

We conducted an open randomized trial to compare the efficacy of parenteral and oral ofloxacin with that of amoxycillin/clavulanate. A total of 121 patients was studied; 92 were clinically evaluable. Of these, 59 patients were treated with ofloxacin and 33 with the comparator drug. Patients were given the drugs intravenously for a minimum of three days followed by oral preparations for the next seven to ten days. Ofloxacin was usually administered as a 200 mg dose bd. In the ofloxacin treated group all patients showed clinical improvement. In the comparator group 94% improved clinically (either a complete or partial response), while 6% were clinical failures. Of the bacteriologically evaluable patients 19 of 20 showed a satisfactory bacteriological response in the ofloxacin treated group, while in the comparator group the bacteriological response was judged satisfactory in 14 of 17 patients. A small proportion of patients (7%) treated with ofloxacin suffered mild adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension and rash). On the whole, ofloxacin was well tolerated by our patients. The two deaths that occurred were in the comparator group. We conclude that ofloxacin in both oral and parenteral forms is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
