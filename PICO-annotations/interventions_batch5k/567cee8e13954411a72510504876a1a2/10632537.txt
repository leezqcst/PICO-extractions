Focal therapeutic efficacy of transcatheter arterial infusion of styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin for hepatocellular carcinoma.

We evaluated the focal therapeutic effect of oily carcinostatic agents administered by transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) as the initial therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Group A (19 patients) received 4 mg of styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin in 4 ml of Lipiodol, and group B (18 patients) received 100 mg of epirubicin in 4 ml of Lipiodol via the tumor feeding arteries as peripherally as possible. The grade of Lipiodol accumulation and the tumor regression rate were determined 2 weeks after TAI by computerized tomography. Adverse effects within 2 weeks after TAI were evaluated by subjective signs and symptoms such as fever (maximum body temperature) and the frequency of shaking chills and abdominal pain, and by biochemical parameters such as albumin, prothrombin time, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Lipiodol accumulation in the tumor was significantly greater in group A (12/19; 63.2% showing grade IV Lipiodol accumulation) than in group B (3/18; 16.7% showing grade IV) (P<0.05). The tumor regression rate was also significantly greater in group A (8/17; 47.1% showing more than 25% tumor regression) than in group B (1/13; 7.7% showing more than 25% tumor regression) (P<0.05). Although clinically significant elevations of aminotransferases and reductions of cholinesterase, and shaking chills were observed more often in group A than in group B (P<0.0001), these factors had little influence on the clinical outcome. Our results suggest that styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin in Lipiodol exerts a more favorable focal therapeutic effect than does epirubicin in Lipiodol in the initial treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
