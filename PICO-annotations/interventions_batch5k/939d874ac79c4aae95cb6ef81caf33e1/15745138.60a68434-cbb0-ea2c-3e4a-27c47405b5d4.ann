T1	Intervention 0 112	Online conductivity monitoring: validation and usefulness in a clinical trial of reduced dialysate conductivity.
T2	Intervention 376 753	For the study, 28 patients were randomized to maintenance of Cndi at 13.6 mS/cm (equivalent to 135 mmol/L of Na+) or serial reduction of Cndi in steps of 0.2 mS/cm, guided by symptoms and blood pressure. Sodium removal estimated from pre- and postplasma concentrations correlated well with removal measured by conductivity monitoring as ionic mass balance (R2 0.66, p < 0.0001)
