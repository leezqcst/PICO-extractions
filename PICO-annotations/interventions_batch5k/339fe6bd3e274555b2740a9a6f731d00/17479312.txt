Use of the electrothermal bipolar vessel system (EBVS) in laparoscopic adrenalectomy: a prospective study.

BACKGROUND Since laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has been adopted as the gold standard for the treatment of adrenal diseases, the development of technology for vascular control and dissection manoeuvres, amongst other things, may play a pivotal role in its further improvement. We report our experience with the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing (EBVS) device for LA.
METHODS From January 2004 to January 2006, 50 patients (pts) undergoing LA were selected and randomized for use of the EBVS (25 pts, group A) versus the UltraSonic Shears (USS) device (25 pts, group B). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), previous surgery and associated diseases were similar between the two groups. The main surgical parameters collected for each patient (pt) concerned operative time, major and minor complications, conversion rate, blood loss, hospital stay and histology.
RESULTS There was no mortality in either group. The right adrenalectomy mean operative time (OpT) was 51.8 mins (range 40-90 mins) and 68.6 mins (range 50-130 mins) in group A and B, respectively (P not significant). The left adrenalectomy mean OpT was 72.2 mins (range 55-100 mins) and 94 mins (range 65-140 mins) for group A and B, respectively (P < 0.05). The mean blood loss was 83 ml (group A) and 210 ml (group B) (p < 0.05). Complications were not different for the two groups. The mean hospital stay was 2.9 and 3.1 days in group A and B, respectively (P not significant).
CONCLUSIONS EBVS in LA may provide a significantly short operating time and blood loss.
