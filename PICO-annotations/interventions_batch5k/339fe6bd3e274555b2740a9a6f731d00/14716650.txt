Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for postoperative pain relief after total knee arthroplasty.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been used to treat chronic pain syndromes and has been reported to be of some utility in the treatment of postsurgical pain. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the utility of TENS after total knee arthroplasty. Patients were randomly enrolled into patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) alone, PCA plus TENS, or PCA plus sham TENS. The cumulative dose of morphine by PCA for each group was used as the end-point of the study. There was no significant reduction in the requirement for patient-controlled analgesia with or without TENS. We conclude that there is no utility for TENS in the postoperative management of pain after knee arthroplasty.
