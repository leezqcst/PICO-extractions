Treatment of adult asthma: controlled double-blind clinical trial of oxitropium bromide.

Sixteen young adult sufferers from extrinsic paroxysmal asthma with pollen hypersensitivity took part in a therapeutic trial of the synthetic anticholinergic agent oxitropium bromide administered by a metered dose inhaler. The study comprised three 3-week periods. The first, run-in period was carried out to confirm the ability of the patients to maintain a daily record of symptoms. During the second and third periods, the patient received 3 X 2 inhalations of drug or placebo in a cross-over design. The medical staff was blind to the nature of the aerosol (drug or placebo), which was given in random order. The run-in clinical score was high. Asymptomatic days were relatively infrequent and daily drug consumption was high. Functional studies between the cross-over periods showed flow-rate values close to normal, with an increase in residual volume and functional residual capacity. During treatment either with placebo or oxitropium, there was a statistically significant decrease in clinical scores. Results for oxitropium bromide treatment were significantly better than the run-in values (p less than 0.005) and the placebo period (p less than 0.02). There was no significant change in non-trial drug consumption. Functional values showed no difference in terms of flow rate, although oxitropium did cause a significant improvement in the RV/TLC ratio (p less than 0.05). No adverse reactions were reported.
