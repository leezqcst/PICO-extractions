Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of two regimens of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines administered to infants primed at birth with hepatitis B vaccine.

An open, randomized study evaluated the immune response and safety of two different regimens of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated poliovirus-Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTPa-HBV-IPV-Hib) immunization in infants primed at birth with hepatitis B vaccine. One-half of the 150 healthy, full-term infants received a DTPa HBV-IPV-Hib vaccine at 1 1/2, 3 and 5 months of age; the other received a DTPa-IPV-Hib vaccine at 1 1/2, 3 and 5 months of age with separate HBV vaccine at 1 and 5 months of age. Immune response was similar following the two regimens with 100% of the vaccinees seroprotected for HBV, diphtheria, tetanus, Hib and poliovirus types 2 and 3 diseases after the full vaccination course. One vaccinee in the DTPa HBV-HPV- Hib group failed to respond to the poliovirus type 1 antigen. Response to the three pertussis antigens ranged from 92-97% in the DTPa-IPV-Hib plus separate HBV group and 100% in the DTPa HBV-IPV-Hib group. The most frequently reported post-vaccination symptoms were irritability in the DTPa-IPV-Hib plus separate HBV group (49% of vaccinees) and fever, defined as axillary temperature > or =37.5 degrees C, in the DTPa HBV- IPV-Hib group (50% of vaccinees).
