A high intake of trans fatty acids has little effect on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in humans.

Consumption of industrial trans fatty acids (iTFA) increases LDL cholesterol, decreases HDL cholesterol, and is strongly associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, changes in circulating cholesterol cannot explain the entire effect. Therefore, we studied whether iTFA and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) affect markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Sixty-one healthy adults consumed each of 3 diets for 3 wk, in random order. Diets were identical except for 7% of energy provided by oleic acid (control diet), iTFA, or CLA. At the end of the 3 wk, we measured plasma inflammatory markers IL-6, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II (TNF-RI and -RII), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and E-selectin, and urinary 8-iso-PGF(2α), a marker of lipid peroxidation. Consumption of iTFA caused 4% lower TNF-RI concentrations and 6% higher E-selectin concentrations compared with oleic acid (control) and had no significant effect on other inflammatory markers. CLA did not significantly affect inflammatory markers. The urine concentration of 8-iso-PGF(2α) [geometric mean (95% CI)] was greater after the iTFA [0.54 (0.48, 0.60) nmol/mmol creatinine] and the CLA [1.2 (1.1, 1.3) nmol/mmol creatinine] diet periods than after the control period [0.45 (0.41, 0.50) nmol/mmol creatinine; P < 0.05]. In conclusion, high intakes of iTFA and CLA did not substantially affect plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers, but they increased the urine 8-iso-PGF(2α) concentration. However, it is unlikely this plays a major role in the mechanism by which iTFA increase the risk of CVD. However, more research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings.
