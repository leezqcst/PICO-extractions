Comparison of short-term efficacy of diltiazem and propranolol in unstable angina at rest--a randomized trial in 70 patients.

The short-term efficacy of diltiazem (D) has been compared to that of propranolol (P), in a group of 70 patients hospitalized in the Coronary Care Unit for unstable angina, defined as recent (less than one month) appearance or aggravation of spontaneous chest pains. Among the 70 patients, 24 had angina only at rest. The patients have been divided into two groups according to ST-T changes during chest pain: 29 with ST elevation (group A) and 41 with other repolarization abnormalities (group B). Treatment was then randomized in each group. Treatment Treatment was considered successful only if spontaneous chest pains disappeared completely. Thirty-four patients were treated with D (282 +/- 102 mg/day) and 36 with P (158 +/- 81 mg/day). In the whole group and in groups A and B considered individually, responses to D and P did not differ. Among the 24 patients with angina exclusively at rest, nine successes and four failures were observed with D. There was no symptomatic relief among the 11 patients treated by P (P = 0.001). Moreover, the number of episodes of angina was decreased by D and unchanged by P, while eight out of the 11 failures with P were immediate successes when treatment was replaced with D. These results suggest that D is preferable to P for management of unstable angina in patients with angina which is exclusively spontaneous.
