Inhibition of spontaneous platelet aggregation and adhesion by indobufen (K 3920). A randomized, double-blind crossover study on platelet, coagulation and fibrinolysis function tests.

In a randomized double-blind crossover study in 12 patients with atherosclerotic disease, the effect of 2 dosages (100 and 200 mg twice daily) of indobufen, a new synthetic inhibition of platelet aggregation, on some platelet functions, coagulation and fibrinolysis tests was investigated. Regardless of the dosage used, indobufen was shown to induce a prompt normalization of the enhanced platelet aggregation of these patients. The effect lasted for the entire period of drug administration and in 50% of patients a normal platelet aggregation was maintained until the fourth day after discontinuation of the drug. Indobufen was also able to reduce platelet adhesiveness and to lengthen bleeding time, especially when the higher dosage was used.
