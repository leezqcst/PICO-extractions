Scales for the assessment of neuroleptic response in schizophrenic children: specific measures derived from the CPRS.

This article reports the psychometric properties of two scales for rating positive and negative schizophrenic signs and symptoms. These Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales consist of items selected from the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), which contains items covering a wide range of childhood psychopathology. CPRS rating data were analyzed for 19 schizophrenic children, 16 males and 3 females, mean age 8.9 years (range 5.5-11.7), evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of haloperidol. We describe the item composition and coherence of each scale, the interrater reliabilities of clinicians using the scales, and the sensitivity of the scales for resolving treatment response. Schizophrenic children showed both positive and negative signs and symptoms, and both improved with neuroleptic treatment.
