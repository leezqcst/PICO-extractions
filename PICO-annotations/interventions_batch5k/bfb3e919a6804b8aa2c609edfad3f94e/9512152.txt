Primary glaucoma triple procedure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma: the effect of mitomycin C in patients with and without prognostic factors for filtration failure.

PURPOSE To investigate the effect of adjunctive mitomycin C on primary glaucoma triple procedure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma with and without one or more of the prognostic factors for filtration failure of primary glaucoma triple procedure. Those factors include being of African-American race, having a preoperative intraocular pressure of 20 mm Hg or more on maximum tolerated medications, and being on two or more medications preoperatively.
METHODS Study patients consisted of 197 consecutive patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who were randomly assigned to receive either no adjunctive mitomycin C (101 eyes of 101 patients) or to receive adjunctive subconjunctival mitomycin C (96 eyes of 96 patients) during the primary glaucoma triple procedure. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis comparisons were made between respective subgroups with and without prognostic indicators for filtration failures using a relatively stringent set of criteria for filtration success of primary glaucoma triple procedure.
RESULTS There was no statistically significant (P = .117) difference in filtration success of primary glaucoma triple procedure between the control and mitomycin C groups. Adjunctive mitomycin C significantly (P < .05) improved the filtration outcome of the primary glaucoma triple procedure in the subgroups with each of the three prognostic factors for filtration failure of primary glaucoma triple procedure. On the other hand, in the subgroups without the prognostic factors, adjunctive mitomycin C did not significantly (P > .05) change the filtration outcome of the primary glaucoma triple procedure.
CONCLUSION These findings establish the basis for selective use of mitomycin C in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma undergoing primary glaucoma triple procedure.
