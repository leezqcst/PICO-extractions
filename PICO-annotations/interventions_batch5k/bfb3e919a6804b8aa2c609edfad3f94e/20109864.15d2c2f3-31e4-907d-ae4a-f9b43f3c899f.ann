T1	Intervention 628 1257	The Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation in Coronary Heart Disease (VTACH) study was a prospective, open, randomised controlled trial, undertaken in 16 centres in four European countries. Patients aged 18-80 years were eligible for enrolment if they had stable VT, previous myocardial infarction, and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; <or=50%). 110 patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive catheter ablation and an ICD (ablation group, n=54) or ICD alone (control group, n=56). Randomisation was done by computer-generated randomly permuted blocks and stratified by centre and LVEF (<or=30% or >30%)
