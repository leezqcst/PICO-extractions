Comparison of the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (Diphereline) and Cabergoline (Dostinex) treatment on uterine myoma regression.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of cabergoline (Dostinex, a dopamine agonist) on the myoma growth compared to Diphereline (a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist).
METHODS This study took place in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran from July 2004 to December 2005. Fifty women with uterine myoma, who met the criteria of the study thoroughly, were randomly allocated into 2 equal groups to take either Diphereline or Cabergoline. The first Group took 3.75 mg of Diphereline 4 times every 28 days and the second group took 0.5 mg of Cabergoline once a week for 6 weeks.
RESULTS The Cabergoline was well tolerated and fewer adverse effects were noted. The tumor regressed significantly and volume reduction rate of individual tumor nodule varied from 46-53%. The gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist group all responded to the treatment, and volume reduction rate of the individual tumor nodule varied from 21-97%. The extent of tumor shrinkage was positively correlated to the number of nodules (p=0.881, p<0.005 and 0.701, p<0.005).
CONCLUSION In light of therapeutic efficacy and few adverse effects, the dopamine agonists may hold promise as novel treatment modalities for leiomyoma. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal strategy for the treatment of leiomyoma through these agents.
