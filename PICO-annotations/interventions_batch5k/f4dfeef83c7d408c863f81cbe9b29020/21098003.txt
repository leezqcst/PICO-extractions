Plasma pH does not influence the cerebral metabolic ratio during maximal whole body exercise.

Exercise lowers the cerebral metabolic ratio of O2 to carbohydrate (glucose+1/2 lactate) and metabolic acidosis appears to promote cerebral lactate uptake. However, the influence of pH on cerebral lactate uptake and, in turn, on the cerebral metabolic ratio during exercise is not known. Sodium bicarbonate (Bicarb, 1 M; 350-500 ml) or an equal volume of normal saline (Sal) was infused intravenously at a constant rate during a '2000 m' maximal ergometer row in six male oarsmen (23±2 years; mean±S.D.). During the Sal trial, pH decreased from 7.41±0.01 at rest to 7.02±0.02 but only to 7.36±0.02 (P <0.05) during the Bicarb trial. Arterial lactate increased to 21.4±0.8 and 32.7±2.3 mM during the Sal and Bicarb trials, respectively (P <0.05). Also, the arterial-jugular venous lactate difference increased from-0.03±0.01 mM at rest to 3.2±0.9 mM (P <0.05) and 3.4±1.4 mM (P <0.05) following the Sal and Bicarb trials, respectively. Accordingly, the cerebral metabolic ratio decreased equally during the Sal and Bicarb trials: from 5.8±0.6 at rest to 1.7±0.1 and 1.8±0.2, respectively. The enlarged blood-buffering capacity after infusion of Bicarb eliminated metabolic acidosis during maximal exercise but that did not affect the cerebral lactate uptake and, therefore, the decrease in the cerebral metabolic ratio.
