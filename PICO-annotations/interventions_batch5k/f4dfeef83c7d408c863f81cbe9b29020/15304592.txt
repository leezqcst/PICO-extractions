Minocycline safety and tolerability in Huntington disease.

Minocycline is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties that prolongs survival in a transgenic Huntington disease (HD) mouse model. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of minocycline in 60 HD patients, the authors determined that over 8 weeks, minocycline at 100 and 200 mg/day was well tolerated and safe in HD patients. Tolerability and adverse event frequency were similar between treatment and placebo groups.
