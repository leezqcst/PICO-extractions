Hypotensive effects and influence on serum lipids of SQ29,852, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with essential hypertension: a comparison with atenolol.

The effects of SQ29,852 (n = 24), a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and atenolol (n = 22), monotherapies were compared in 46 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both SQ29,852 (mean dose 15.0 +/- 5.1 mg/day) and atenolol (mean dose 37.5 +/- 18.5 mg/day) significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. There were no significant changes in serum lipids, apolipoproteins, lipoproteins or atherosclerotic indices after both SQ29,852 and atenolol. There were also no significant inter-group differences. There were no serious side effects or abnormal laboratory tests in both treatment groups. It is concluded that SQ29,852 is an effective antihypertensive drug without adverse effect on lipid metabolism.
