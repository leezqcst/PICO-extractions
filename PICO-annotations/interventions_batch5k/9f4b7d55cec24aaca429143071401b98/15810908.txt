B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII preparations are bioequivalent to a monoclonal antibody purified plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate: a randomized, three-way crossover study.

BACKGROUND Deletion of the B-domain of recombinant blood coagulation factor VIII (BDDrFVIII) increases the manufacturing yield of the product but does not impair in vitro or in vivo functionality. BDDrFVIII (ReFacto) has been developed with the additional benefit of being formulated without human albumin.
OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this three-way crossover-design study was to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of two BDDrFVIII formulations (one reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile water, the other reconstituted with 4 mL sodium chloride 0.9% USP) with those of a plasma-derived, full-length FVIII preparation (Hemofil M) in patients with haemophilia A to determine bioequivalence.
METHODS A series of blood samples were collected over a period of 48 h after i.v. administration of each of the FVIII preparations. Plasma FVIII activity was determined using a validated chromogenic substrate assay. Plasma FVIII activity vs. time curves was characterized for a standard set of PK parameter estimates. Two parameter estimates, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUCs), were used to evaluate bioequivalence. The two preparations were considered bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric means for Cmax and AUCs fell within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%.
RESULTS/CONCLUSION Results show that each BDDrFVIII formulation is bioequivalent to Hemofil M and the two formulations of BDDrFVIII are bioequivalent to each other.
