[Study on classification and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis].

OBJECTIVE To determine the clinical manifestations of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and to study the mycologic eradication rate of different miconazole treatment courses for VVC.
METHODS Three hundred cases of VVC were recruited. The Candidas were cultured. A prospective and randomized study was performed to compare the treatment effect of 3 day miconazole (400 mg/d), 6 day miconazole (400 mg/d), and 7 day miconazole (200 mg/d) for uncomplicated and complicated VVC.
RESULTS Among 300 cases of VVC, uncomplicated, complicated and recurrent VVC were 56.0%, 44.0% and 9.7% (29/300) respectively. C. albicans was isolated most frequently 90.3% (271/300), followed by C. glabrata (7.3%), C. tropicalis (1.3%), C. krusei (0.7%), and C. parapsilosis (0.3 %). Mycologic eradication rate of 3 day, 6 day and 7 day miconazole courses for uncomplicated VVC at day 14 was 96.0%, 93.5% and 98.0%, respectively (P > 0.05). Eradication rate of 3 day, 6 day and 7 day miconazole courses for complicated VVC at day 14 was 86.7%, 92.5%, and 86.4%, respectively (P > 0.05). Eradication rate of 3 day, 6 day and 7 day miconazole courses for uncomplicated VVC at day 35 was 93.8%, 95.3%, and 89.8%, respectively (P > 0.05). Eradication rate of 3 day, 6 day and 7 day miconazole courses for complicated VVC at day 35 was 89.7%, 97.3% and 86.8%, respectively (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION Treatment of VVC should be individualized, and women with complicated VVC achieve superior mycologic eradication by a 6 day miconazole course.
