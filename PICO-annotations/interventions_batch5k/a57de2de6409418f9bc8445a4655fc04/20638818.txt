Prospective randomized trial of short-term neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND We performed short-term neoadjuvant chemotherapy (s-NAC) to examine whether anticancer drugs can change the proliferative ability of cancer cells in gastric cancer patients.
METHODS Chemotherapy was performed for 72 h before gastrectomy in 63 gastric cancer patients. Patients were classed into four groups: Group F, 16 cases who received a single administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); Group C, 15 cases who received a single administration of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP; cisplatin); Group FC, 16 cases who received both 5-FU+CDDP; and a Control group, 16 cases who did not receive chemotherapy. We reviewed neoadjuvant biopsy tissue and gastric cancer tissue delivered by operation in these cases. The TUNEL method and immunohistochemistry with an anti-MIB-1 antibody were used to evaluate cellular apoptosis and proliferative ability, respectively. The apoptotic index (AI) and an MIB-1 index (MI) were also calculated.
RESULTS There were no differences in AI or MI in biopsy tissue between the groups. The AI of gastric cancer tissue in Group FC was significantly higher than in the other groups (P < 0.01). The MI of Group FC was significantly lower than in the other groups (P < 0.05). In addition, after s-NAC operation there was a significant inhibition of proliferative potency and an induction of apoptosis in Group FC.
CONCLUSION Combination of CDDP and 5-FU reduced proliferative potency and increased cellular apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.
