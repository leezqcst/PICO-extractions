Physical health--a cluster randomized controlled lifestyle intervention among persons with a psychiatric disability and their staff.

The objective was to explore the impact on physical health of a lifestyle programme among persons with psychiatric disabilities, and their caregivers. Their satisfaction with the intervention was also assessed. Somatic comorbidity and an increased mortality related to the lifestyle among persons with psychiatric disabilities are well known. Few randomized controlled trials have been aimed specifically at lifestyle issues among persons with a psychiatric disability. This trial includes clients with psychiatric disabilities living in supported housing and their staff. Forty-one persons with a DSM-?V diagnosis of severe mental illness from psychiatric disability from 10 supported housing facilities and 41 of their caregivers participated in this 12-month study during 2005-2006 in Sweden. The supported housing facilities with residents and staff were randomly assigned to either a health intervention programme or a control programme with an aesthetic content. The presence of metabolic syndrome and changes in the mean of physiological parameters such as Hba1c, P-glucose, P-insulin, lipids, blood pressure, physical working capacity, body mass index, Heart Score were investigated and participants' satisfaction assessed. There was a significant reduction in the mean of metabolic syndrome criteria in the intervention group compared with the control group at the follow-up. The participants expressed satisfaction with the programme. The results indicate that health interventions on lifestyle issues when involving carers are appreciated, feasible and could be successful in reducing some health-related risk factors among persons with psychiatric disabilities.
