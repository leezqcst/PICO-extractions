Effect of finasteride treatment on suburethral prostatic microvessel density in patients with hematuria related to benign prostate hyperplasia.

INTRODUCTION In the present study we evaluated the effect of short-term finasteride treatment on microvessel density (MVD) which is an indicator of prostatic angiogenesis in patients with hematuria secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS 30 patients who were candidates for BPH surgery were prospectively included in the study. All patients had history of gross hematuria and evaluated by ultrasonography and cystoscopy. The patients were randomized two groups before surgery. The treatment group consisted of 13 patients who were given 5 mg finasteride daily for 4 weeks before surgery. The control group consisted of 17 patients who did not receive finasteride before surgery. During surgery, resected suburethral and hyperplastic prostate specimens were sent for histopathologic MVD determination separately.
RESULTS Mean MVD in the suburethral portion of prostate was significantly lower in patients treated with finasteride when compared with controls (9.08 +/- 5.6 and 13.94 +/- 5.90, respectively, p < 0.05). Mean MVD for the hyperplastic portion of prostate was similar for the finasteride and control groups (14.21 +/- 7.10 and 19.75 +/- 9.73, respectively, p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION The potential role of finasteride on hematuria related to BPH may be the suppressive effect on MVD in the suburethral tissue of prostate.
