Topical PUVA, etretinate, and combined PUVA and etretinate for palmoplantar pustulosis: comparison of therapeutic efficacy and the influences of tonsillar and dental focal infections.

Twenty patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) were treated with topical PUVA, oral etretinate (Re), or combined PUVA and etretinate (Re-PUVA). Re and Re-PUVA treated sites improved and/or cleared more rapidly than PUVA treated sites. Complete clearance was observed in six of ten sites treated with Re-PUVA, two of ten with Re, and one of ten sites with PUVA within 12 weeks. UVA-control sites failed to be cleared within 12 weeks. Remission periods after stopping the treatment were 1.5 +/- 0.5 weeks (n = 2) with Re, 10.5 +/- 11.4 weeks (n = 6) with Re-PUVA, and one year (n = 1) with PUVA. These results overall suggested that Re-PUVA is the most effective treatment for PPP. Tonsillar focal infection (TFI) and dental focal infection (DFI) were found in 6/20 and 17/20 patients, respectively. However, the presence of focal infection (FI), TFI and/or DFI, did not appear to interfere with the therapeutic activities of Re and/or PUVA, because the complete clearance rates and remission periods in FI(+) patients were comparable with those in FI(-) patients.
