T1	Intervention 343 1028	The participants consisted of 60 unfit male university undergraduate students with no previous training in stress management who were randomly and evenly assigned to engage in one of four treatments over 10 weeks: (a) moderate aerobic exercise, (b) progressive relaxation, (c) a placebo group that engaged in group discussion but did experience acute stress, and (d) a nonintervention control group that did not experience stress while performing the motor task. Acute stress consisted of "losing" against a competitor of the opposite sex on the criterion motor task while receiving unpleasant information about their performance over 30 preintervention and 30 postintervention trials.
