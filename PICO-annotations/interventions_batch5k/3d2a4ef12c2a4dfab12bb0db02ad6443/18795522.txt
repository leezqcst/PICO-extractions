Influence of occlusal access on demineralized dentin removal in the atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) approach.

PURPOSE To verify the influence of cavity access diameter on demineralized dentin removal in the ART approach.
METHODS 40 non-carious human premolars were randomly divided into four groups. The occlusal surface was ground flat and the teeth were sectioned mesio-distally. The hemi-sections were reassembled and occlusal access preparations were carried out using ball-shaped diamonds. The resulting size of the occlusal opening was 1.0 mm, 1.4 mm, 1.6 mm and 1.8 mm for Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Standardized artificial carious lesions were created and demineralized dentin was excavated. After excavation, the cavities were analyzed using: (a) the tactile method, (b) caries-detection dye to stain demineralized dentin, as proposed by Smales & Fang, and (c) Demineralized Tissue Removal index, as proposed in this study. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher, Spearman correlation coefficient, kappa, Kruskal-Wallis and Miller tests (P < 0.05).
RESULTS The three methods of evaluation showed no significant difference between Groups A vs. B, and C vs. D, while statistically significant differences were observed between Groups A vs. C, A vs. D, B vs. C and B vs. D. Based on the results of this study, the size of occlusal access significantly affected the efficacy of demineralized tissue removal.
