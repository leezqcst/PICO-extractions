A pilot study of a low-tilt biphasic waveform for transvenous cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: improved efficacy compared with conventional capacitor-based waveforms in patients.

BACKGROUND The optimal waveform tilt for defibrillation is not known. Most modern defibrillators used for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) employ high-tilt, capacitor-based biphasic waveforms.
METHODS We have developed a low-tilt biphasic waveform for defibrillation. This low-tilt waveform was compared with a conventional waveform of equivalent duration and voltage in patients with AF. Patients with persistent AF or AF induced during a routine electrophysiology study (EPS) were randomized to receive either the low-tilt waveform or a conventional waveform. Defibrillation electrodes were positioned in the right atrial appendage and distal coronary sinus. Phase 1 peak voltage was increased in a stepwise progression from 50 V to 300V. Shock success was defined as return of sinus rhythm for >/=30 seconds.
RESULTS The low-tilt waveform produced successful termination of persistent AF at a mean voltage of 223 V (8.2 J) versus 270 V (6.7 J) with the conventional waveform (P = 0.002 for voltage, P = ns for energy). In patients with induced AF the mean voltage for the low-tilt waveform was 91V (1.6 J) and for the conventional waveform was 158 V (2.0 J) (P = 0.005 for voltage, P = ns for energy). The waveform was much more successful at very low voltages (less than or equal to 100 V) compared with the conventional waveform (Novel: 82% vs Conventional 22%, P = 0.008).
CONCLUSION The low-tilt biphasic waveform was more successful for the internal cardioversion of both persistent and induced AF in patients (in terms of leading edge voltage).
