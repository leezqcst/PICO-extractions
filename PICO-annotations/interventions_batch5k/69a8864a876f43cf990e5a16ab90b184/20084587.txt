[Evaluation of Stepping Stones Triple P: Interims analysis of the Stepping-Stones-SPC-Multicentric Study].

Stepping Stones Triple P is a behavioural parenting training for families with a handicapped child, which has already been successfully evaluated in its country of origin, Australia. Within a multicentric study of several Social Pediatric Centers (SPCs) and further clinics/institutions in Germany, it has been established as a group parenting training (3-7 families per training). Statistical analysis proved significant effects concerning dysfunctional parenting, parental stress and child behaviour problems as well as little side effects and a positive acceptance of stepping stones by the families.
