Ethanol-induced alterations in electroencephalographic activity in adult males.

The present investigation examined the effects of placebo (P), low-dose (LD), and high-dose (HD) ethanol on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in 21 healthy, adult males (X = 22.7 years). Only one condition (P, LD, or HD) was presented per day and the condition order was randomized. For each subject, blood-alcohol levels measured via breathalyzer and EEG activity, using the entire 10/20 International System, were recorded both prior to and at intervals of 35, 70, 105, and 140 minutes after P, LD, or HD administration. The Fast Fourier Transform was used to calculate power spectral densities for each EEG recording. Measures of the relative areas under the power spectral curve were made for each of the following frequency bands: slow alpha (7.5 to 10 Hz); fast alpha (10.5 to 13.0 Hz); slow beta (13.5 to 19.5 Hz); and fast beta (20 to 26 Hz) at electrodes F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance performed on normalized relative area values revealed that ethanol had significant effects on EEG activity at anterior sites: frontal (F3, F4) and central (C3, C4) that presented as increased activity in the slow alpha frequency band. These results suggest a differential responsivity of both cortical region and EEG frequency band to the effects of ethanol ingestion.
