Mass inoculation in a community: the effect of primary prevention of stress reactions.

This study assessed the effectiveness of a brief, situation-specific, group-administered preparatory intervention in a nonclient school population undergoing mass inoculation against rubella. Fifty-one girls were randomly assigned to practice, no-practice, or control groups. Both the practice and the no-practice groups received information that described the inoculation procedure and how to cope with it by using cognitive-behavioral coping skills. The practice group was encouraged to perform coping techniques of this type, whereas the no-practice group was told only that the intervention would help them during the inoculation. Subjects in both practice and no-practice groups reported less anxiety and exhibited more cooperative behavior during inoculation than subjects in the control group, and those who were guided and prompted to actively practice derived greater benefit.
