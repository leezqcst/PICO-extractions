T1	Intervention 202 407	To determine whether Pgp inhibition improves treatment outcome in CML-BP, the Southwest Oncology Group performed a randomized, controlled trial testing the benefit of the Pgp modulator, cyclosporin A (CsA)
T2	Intervention 409 673	Seventy-three eligible patients were assigned to treatment with cytarabine and infusional daunorubicin with or without intravenous CsA. Treatment with CsA yielded no improvement in treatment outcome as measured by the frequency of induction resistance (68% vs 53%)
