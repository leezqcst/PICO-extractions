Human recombinant GM-CSF in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia: double-blind placebo controlled trial.

A double-blind randomised trial compared 20 patients with leukaemia receiving human recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF), with 20 patients receiving placebo for 14 days after allogeneic matched sibling bone marrow transplantation. The median neutrophil count at 14 days was significantly higher in the GM CSF group (1.90 vs. 0.46 x 10(9)/l). The duration of hospital stay, the number of antibiotic days, and the number of fever days was the same for both patient groups. The lymphocyte count was significantly higher in the GM-CSF group than in the placebo group between days 10 and 15 after transplantation. The GM-CSF group had lower haemoglobin concentrations and platelets counts, and higher plasma urea creatinine and bilirubin, than the placebo group. There was no evidence that GM CSF was associated with a greater incidence of leukaemic relapse.
