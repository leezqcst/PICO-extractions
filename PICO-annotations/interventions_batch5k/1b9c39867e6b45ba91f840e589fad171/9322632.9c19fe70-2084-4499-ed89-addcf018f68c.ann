OBJECTIVE Our purpose was to compare the effect of vaginal administration of misoprostol (Cytotec) with that of dinoprostone (Cervidil) on cervical ripening and labor induction. STUDY DESIGN Two hundred patients with indications for induction of labor and unfavorable cervical examinations were randomly assigned to receive vaginally administered misoprostol (prostaglandin E1) or the dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2) vaginal insert. Twenty-five microgram tablets of misoprostol were placed in the posterior vaginal fornix every 4 hours for a maximum of six doses. Additional misoprostol was not given after either spontaneous rupture of membranes, adequate cervical ripening (Bishop score of > or = 8 or cervical dilatation of > or = 3 cm), or beginning of active labor. The vaginal insert, Cervidil, containing 10 mg of dinoprostone in a timed-release preparation was placed in the posterior vaginal formix for a maximum period of 24 hours. The vaginal insert was removed for spontaneous rupture of membranes, entry into active labor, adequate cervical ripening, or abnormality of uterine contractile pattern or fetal cardiac activity. RESULTS Of the 200 patients enrolled, 99 were randomized to misoprostol and 101 to dinoprostone. The average interval from start of induction to vaginal delivery was 1 hour shorter in the misop
