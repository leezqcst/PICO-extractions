Hypericum treatment of mild depressions with somatic symptoms.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 39 patients with depression with somatic symptoms were treated with hypericum extract LI 160. The therapy lasted for 4 weeks; the dosage was 300 mg three times daily. At the onset of the study as well as after 2 and 4 weeks, the following criteria were analyzed: HAMD, B-L, CGI, and vegetative symptoms. The results show a significant improvement in the active treatment group at the 5% level as compared to placebo. Seventy percent of the patients treated with LI 160 were free of symptoms after 4 weeks. Typical symptoms of the depression such as lack of activity, tiredness, fatigue, and disturbed sleep, were especially responsive. In no case were any undesirable side effects observed.
