The efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy for respiratory allergy is not affected by different dosage regimens in the induction phase.

BACKGROUND Sublingual administration of allergens is a safe and effective alternative to subcutaneous immunotherapy in patients with respiratory allergies. A drawback to this therapeutic approach is the relatively long and complex management of the induction phase.
AIM OF THE STUDY To determine whether different induction regimens affect the outcome of sublingual immunotherapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS Adult and pediatric patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma were included in the study. Ten subjects served as controls and received symptomatic treatments. Forty-three subjects were allocated to sublingual immunotherapy, with three different induction protocols (8-, 15- and 20-day, respectively). Symptom and medication scores, skin test results and (in asthmatic patients) FEV1 values were monitored for two years. Adverse effects were recorded. All induction regimens produced a significant improvement in symptom and medication usage (p < 0.0001); skin test scores decreased (p < 0.0001) and FEV1 improved (p < 0.05). In contrast, symptom and skin test scores did not significantly change in controls. No relevant adverse effects were observed with any of the induction regimens.
CONCLUSIONS For patients with respiratory allergies, sublingual immunotherapy with an 8-day induction protocol is safe and effective. Our results encourage the usage of shorter induction regimens, which produce better compliance with this therapy.
