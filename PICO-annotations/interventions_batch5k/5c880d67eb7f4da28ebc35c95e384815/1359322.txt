Amphotericin versus pentamidine in antimony-unresponsive kala-azar.

We compared the efficacy of amphotericin B and pentamidine isethionate in a prospective randomised trial in 120 uncomplicated and parasitologically confirmed cases of antimony-unresponsive kala-azar. Doses were twenty intramuscular injections of pentamidine 4 mg/kg on alternate days or fourteen definitive doses of amphotericin 0.5 mg/kg infused in 5% dextrose on alternate days. 48 (80%) patients given pentamidine showed initial cure and 46 (77%) showed definitive cure compared with 60 (100%) and 59 (98%) cases, respectively, on amphotericin (p < 0.001). Amphotericin also brought about quicker abatement of fever and more complete spleen regression.
