The maximal double step length test can evaluate more adequately the decrease of physical function with age, than the maximal single step length test.

The maximal double step length (MDSL) test is a modified version of the maximal step length (MSL) test used to evaluate the dynamic balance related to falls in the elderly. Although this test can evaluate their physical function using movements similar to daily activities as compared to MSL, it has not been clarified whether it can adequately evaluate the activities of daily living (ADL) abilities of the elderly, as they decrease with age. This study aimed to examine the relationship between both MSL and MDSL on age and ADL in elderly subjects. Fifty-seven elderly females who live independently (age 74.8Â±5.6 years) were recruited. MSL and MDSL were conducted twice after completing an ADL questionnaire. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of both tests were high (for MSL: ICC=0.95, for MDSL: ICC=0.81-0.82). Age and ADL significantly correlated to MDSL (age: r=-0.32-0.41, ADL: r=0.28-0.48), but not to MSL (age: r=-0.19, ADL: r=0.15). MDSL has high reliability as it relates to age and ADL. It may be more useful to evaluate ADL required for independent living and prevent falls in the elderly better than MSL.
