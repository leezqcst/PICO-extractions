[The effects of early enteral nutrition with addition of probiotics on the prognosis of patients suffering from severe acute pancreatitis].

OBJECTIVE To investigate the curative effect of early enteral nutrition (EN) supplemented with probiotics (bifidobacterium) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (ASP).
METHODS Seventy SAP cases admitted from January 2005 to October 2012 were randomly assigned into parenteral nutrition (PN) group (n=22), EN group (n=25) and bifidobacterium added EN (P+EN) group (n=23). In P+EN group, patients were given their nutrition the same as that of EN, and also probiotics (bifidobacterium, 4 capsules every 12 hours, given through nasal gastric tube, each capsule weighing 210 mg). The routine treatment including anti-infection and anti-acid agents, and that of inhibition of pancreatic secretion were given, except for the different nutritional interventions in all groups. The blood samples were collected for e same measurements of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for the C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell (WBC) count, amylase and lipase by biochemistry assay 1 day before intervention of nutrition, and 7 days and 14 days after intervention. Changes in organ function and outcome were also recorded at the same time points.
RESULTS The plasma levels of IL-8, TNF-α, CRP, LDH, WBC count, amylase and lipase were significantly reduced after nutritional intervention compared with their levels on day 1 before intervention in all three groups. The plasma IL-8, TNF-α, CRP, lipase, LDH at 14 days after intervention of nutrition in P+EN group were significantly lower than those in PN group and EN group (IL-8: 21.00 ± 7.07 μg/L vs. 48.00 ± 10.32 μg/L, 32.00 ± 9.30 μg/L; TNF-α: 44.3 ± 10.9 ng/L vs. 132.1 ± 34.1 ng/L, 67.8 ± 22.3 ng/L; CRP: 35.0 ± 12.4 mg/L vs. 103.2 ± 49.2 mg/L, 63.0 ± 29.2 mg/L; lipase: 269 ± 79 U/L vs. 670 ± 145 U/L, 310 ± 78 U/L; LDH: 21.8 ± 10.3 U/L vs. 78.1 ± 37.4 U/L, 37.9 ± 25.1 U/L, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The WBC count in P+EN group was significantly lower than that in PN group (5.9 ± 3.0 × 10⁹/L, 6.3 ± 3.2 × 10⁹/L vs. 9.6 ± 3.0 ×10⁹/L, both P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in amylase between P+EN group and PN group (211 ± 49 U/L, 236 ± 52 U/L vs. 298 ± 71 U/L, P>0.05). The gastrointestinal dysfunction score in P+EN, EN, PN groups 14 days after nutritional intervention was 0.28 ± 0.05, 0.43 ± 0.09, 0.71 ± 0.11, respectively, with statistically significant differences (all P<0.01). Compared with PN and EN groups, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1 vs. 9, 2), infection and abscess (2 vs. 12, 5) was lower (all P<0.01), and hospital day was significantly shortened in P+EN group (10.4 ± 3.9 days vs. 25.8 ± 6.4 days, 13.4 ± 5.2 days, both P<0.01). There was no significant statistical difference in mortality rate among three groups.
CONCLUSION Our results indicated that early EN with addition of probiotics (bifidobacterium) resulted in significant lowering of the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, earlier restoration of gastrointestinal function, decrease of complications such as infection, and shortening of hospital day in patients with SAP.
