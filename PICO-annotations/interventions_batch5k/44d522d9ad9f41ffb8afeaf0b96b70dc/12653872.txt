Multiple risk factor intervention reduces cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients with echolucent plaques in the carotid artery.

OBJECTIVE In a previously published randomized 6-year study we observed that multiple risk factor intervention reduced cardiovascular risk in high-risk hypertensive men, and that this effect was confined to patients with carotid artery plaques. Hypothetically, the underlying mechanism might have been a stabilization of echolucent, instable, rupture-prone plaques. The aim of the present study was to examine plaque characteristics by B-mode ultrasound in the previous intervention study, and also to investigate the relationship between plaque characteristics at baseline and cardiovascular events during the 6-year follow-up in the two randomization groups.
METHODS High resolution B-mode ultrasound was used to characterize plaque echogenicity in four subgroups - dominantly echolucent, substantially echolucent, dominantly echogenic, and uniformly echogenic.
RESULTS In the usual care group 17 of 32 (53%) patients with echolucent plaques at baseline suffered from a combined end-point (any death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) during follow-up compared with seven of 28 (25%) patients in the intervention group (P = 0.036). The corresponding numbers in patients with echogenic plaques were n = 4/13 (31%) and n = 4/17 (24%), respectively (NS). In the usual care group 11 of 33 (33%) patients with no plaques suffered from a combined end-point during follow-up compared with 11 of 30 (37%) in the intervention group.
CONCLUSION Our data indicate that the beneficial effect of the multiple risk intervention programme was confined to those patients with echolucent plaques. The data have to be confirmed with a large-scale trial.
