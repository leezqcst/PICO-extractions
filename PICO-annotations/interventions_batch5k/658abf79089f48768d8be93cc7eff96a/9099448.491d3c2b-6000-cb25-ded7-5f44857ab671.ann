T1	Intervention 486 790	The equations describing the models for AUC using two time points (3 and 24h) and Cmax for the training data set of 30 subjects were AUCpredicted = 11.1 C3h + 121.4 C24h - 157 (r = 0.80) Cmax(predicted) = 0.036 AUC + 42.9 (r = 0.74) The model was validated on 64 patients who received flunarizine orally.
