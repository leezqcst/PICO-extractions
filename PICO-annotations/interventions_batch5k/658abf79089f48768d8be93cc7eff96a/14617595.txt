Remifentanil with morphine transitional analgesia shortens neurological recovery compared to fentanyl for supratentorial craniotomy.

PURPOSE To compare the recovery profiles, efficacy and safety of remifentanil and morphine for transitional analgesia with fentanyl in patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial mass lesions.
METHODS Ninety-one patients were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, multicentre study. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and remifentanil (1.0 micro g x kg(-1) bolus and a 1 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion) or fentanyl (1 micro g x kg(-1) bolus and a 1.0 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion). The opioid infusion continued until the level of anesthesia was deemed appropriate for intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with N(2)O/O(2), isoflurane 0.5 MAC and remifentanil 0.2 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1) or fentanyl 0.04 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1). At bone flap replacement, either morphine 0.08 mg x kg(-1) (remifentanil group) or saline (fentanyl group) was given.
RESULTS Systolic blood pressure was greater in those receiving fentanyl during induction (145.6 +/-17.5 mmHg vs 128.8 +/-18.3 mmHg; P = 0.006) and intubation (126.9 +/-17.1 vs 110.9 +/-16.5 mmHg; P < 0.001). Median time to tracheal extubation was similar but less variable in the remifentanil group (remifentanil = 8 min: range = 2-44 min; fentanyl = 8 min: range = 1-732 min). The fentanyl patients required a longer time to achieve the first normal neurological score (fentanyl = 38.0 min; remifentanil = 26.0 min; P = 0.035). Both the anesthesiologists and the recovery room nurses rated remifentanil better with respect to level of consciousness. Analgesics were required earlier in patients receiving remifentanil; median time 0.5 vs 1.08 hr, P < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS Remifentanil is a suitable alternative to fentanyl in supratentorial craniotomy. Time to preoperative neurological recovery is faster and morphine provides some transitional analgesia without compromising the quality of recovery.
