Evaluation of a device to facilitate female urethral catheterization.

Urethral catheterization is a skilled procedure that nurses in hospital settings perform routinely. The opening of the female urethra is located within the vulvar vestibule, making insertion of urinary catheters into females a greater technical challenge than in males. Researchers evaluated whether a new device might decrease the time required for catheter insertion, increase the likelihood of inserting the catheter on the first attempt (improved accuracy), and reduce patient discomfort. Comments about the device from both patients and nurses also are reported.
