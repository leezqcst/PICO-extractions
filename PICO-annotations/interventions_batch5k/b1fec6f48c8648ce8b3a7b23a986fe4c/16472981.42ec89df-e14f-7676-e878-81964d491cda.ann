T1	Intervention 0 117	Effects of cooking plant oils on recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
T2	Intervention 129 244	One-third of the total population seems to develop minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) during their lifetime.
T3	Intervention 486 522	Thirty subjects (8 men and 22 women)
T4	Intervention 874 961	subjects were asked to use soybean oil or perilla oil as the sole cooking oil for 8 mo.
T5	Intervention 1211 1372	alpha-Linolenic acid concentrations in the plasma phospholipid fraction increased significantly in both groups during the experimental phase to a similar extent.
T6	Intervention 1561 1668	Perilla oil, which is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, was not superior to soybean oil in preventing minor RAS
T7	Intervention 1670 1769	There was a possibility that avoiding rapeseed oil might be beneficial for prevention of minor RAS.
