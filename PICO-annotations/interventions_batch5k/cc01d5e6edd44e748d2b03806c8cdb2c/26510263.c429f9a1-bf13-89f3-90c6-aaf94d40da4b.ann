T1	Intervention 362 824	We hypothesised differing effects of propofol and isoflurane on inflammatory markers in patients having CBR Forty patients undergoing elective CPB were randomised to receive either propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anaesthesia. CRP, IL-6, IL-8, HIF-1Î± (ELISA), CD11 and CD18 expression (flow cytometry), and haemoxygenase (HO-1) promoter polymorphisms (PCR/electrophoresis) were measured before anaesthetic induction, 4 hours post-CPB, and 24 hours later
