Clinic visit and waiting: patient education and satisfaction.

Patients who were taught about their health problems while waiting in the clinic (n = 104) were significantly more satisfied with the education received during that visit than the control group (n = 101). The longer patients waited in the clinic to see their providers, the less satisfied they were with the clinic visit.
