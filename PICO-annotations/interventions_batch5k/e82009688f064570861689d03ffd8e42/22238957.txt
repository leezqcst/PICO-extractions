[Pharmacological correction of free radical disturbances and endotoxicosis in patients with diffuse peritonitis at the postoperative period].

The examination and treatment of 64 patients have shown that inclusion of complex antioxidant cytoflavin in intensive therapy at the postoperative period of diffuse peritonitis allows the hypoxia degree to be decreased that in its turn results in quicker recovery of the antioxidant system and decreased activity of peroxidation and endotoxicosis level. The clinical course of the postoperative period of diffuse peritonitis with cytoflavin included in intensive therapy is characterized by shorter terms of artificial lung ventilation, shorter time of staying in critical condition, more favorable course of complications.
