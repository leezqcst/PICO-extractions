A comparison of urinary and sexual outcomes in women experiencing vaginal and Caesarean births.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the urinary and sexual consequences of vaginal delivery compared with Caesarean section.
METHODS We performed a cohort analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of episiotomy conducted in 3 Montreal hospitals in 1990-1991. Of the 999 trial participants for whom follow-up data were available, 135 delivered by Caesarean section (CS), and 864 had a vaginal birth (VB). After stratifying for parity, we compared rates of urinary incontinence (UI) and sexual functioning at 3 months postpartum in women who had a VB with the rates in women who had a CS.
RESULTS Primiparous women reported unspecified UI at 3 months postpartum more often (17.9%) in the VB group than in the CS group (6.4%). This difference remained significant whether or not there was a prior history of UI. Multiparous women showed no difference in rates of UI (VB 17.1% vs. CS 16.0%), whether there was a prior history of UI or not. Stress incontinence was greater among primiparous women in the VB group (VB 34.5% vs. CS 12.8%) regardless of prior UI history, but the proportion of women whose UI was severe enough to wear a pad was similar in primiparous women (VB 16.0%, CS 15.4%) and multiparous women (VB 23.8%, CS 25.0%). Women's sexual dissatisfaction was greater among primiparous women who had a vaginal birth (VB 70.1%, CS 54.5%), but in multiparous women, the rates of sexual dissatisfaction were similar (VB 64.2%, CS 71.4%). The frequency of dyspareunia for each mode of delivery was similar in primiparous women (VB 30.7%, CS 31.6%). Overall, both primiparous and multiparous women who had intact perineums after VB had less dyspareunia than those undergoing CS (VB 26.2, CS 40.7%). However, the proportion of women experiencing dyspareunia was greatest among those who had an episiotomy with or without forceps.
