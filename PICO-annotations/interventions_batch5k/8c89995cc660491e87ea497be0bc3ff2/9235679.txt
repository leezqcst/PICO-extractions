[Clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis after hip replacement surgery].

Hip replacement surgery is associated with a high frequency of postoperative deep vein thrombosis. This prospective study was performed in order to investigate if routine bedside questioning and examination by the visiting doctor could reveal deep vein thrombosis in the legs of patients who had received a hip replacement. 258 patients were evaluated. Thromboprophylaxis (dextran-70, low molecular weight heparin and graded elastic stockings) was given during the first week after operation. Bilateral venography was performed in all patients on day seven after operation, and showed an overall deep vein thrombosis incidence of 16%. The visiting doctors had not suspected deep vein thrombosis in any of the patients. This may have been because postoperative painful and swollen legs effectively masked any signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Our results show that deep vein thrombosis during the first week after hip replacement surgery cannot be discovered by clinical diagnostics. The high subclinical frequency of deep vein thrombosis indicates the importance of improving thromboprophylaxis in order to further minimise the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis and the risk of thromboembolic complications.
