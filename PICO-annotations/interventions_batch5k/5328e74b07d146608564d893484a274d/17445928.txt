A randomised trial of radiotherapy compared with cisplatin chemo-radiotherapy in patients with unresectable squamous cell cancer of the esophagus.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Following our phase II experience, a randomised trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy in patients with unresectable squamous cell cancer of the esophagus.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients randomised to the RT group received 50 Gy/25 fx/5 weeks of teletherapy followed 1-2 weeks later with 12 Gy/2 fx of high-dose-rate intra-lumenal brachytherapy spaced a week apart. Following the first 3 years of recruitment, due to unexpected late morbidity, brachytherapy was excluded and the protocol modified to 66 Gy/33 fx/6.5 weeks. The CRT group received identical radiotherapy with concurrent weekly cisplatin at 35 mg/m(2) for 6-7 cycles.
RESULTS Between April 1999 and December 2005, 125 patients were randomised to a RT (n=60) or CRT group (n=65). Radiotherapy treatment was completed in 78% (47/60) of the RT group and 89% (58/65) of the CRT group (P=0.10). Six or more cycles of cisplatin could be delivered in 63% (41/65), which resulted in RTOG grade 3 neutropenia of 3%. Late morbidity in the form of ulcers (5% vs. 15% odds ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.08-1.11, P=0.08) and strictures (13% vs. 28%, odds ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-1.01, P=0.05) was observed in the RT and CRT groups, respectively. At a median follow up of 23 months of all patients alive (range 6-82 months) and with 95/125 events, the median, 1, 2 and 5 year projected survival was 7.1 months, 32.3%, 22.8% and 13.7% vs. 13.4 months, 57.6%, 38.9% and 24.8% for the RT and CRT groups, respectively (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98, P=0.038).
CONCLUSIONS The addition of concurrent cisplatin to radiotherapy resulted in a modest improvement in survival and was associated with manageable additional acute and late morbidity.
