T1	Intervention 125 725	his prospective, 6-week, multicenter, double-blind study examined the benefits of initiating treatment with combination valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared with initial valsartan monotherapy for 648 patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension (age=52.6+/-10 years; 54% male; baseline blood pressure (BP)=161/98 mm Hg, 32% stage 1). Patients were randomized to valsartan 80 mg (V-low), valsartan 160 mg (V-high) or valsartan/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (V/HCTZ), and electively titrated after weeks 2 and 4 to the next dosage level (maximum dose valsartan/HCTZ 160/25 mg) if BP remained >140/90 mm Hg
