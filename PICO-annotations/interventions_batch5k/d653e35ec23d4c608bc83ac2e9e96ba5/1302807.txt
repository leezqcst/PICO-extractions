Shorter treatment for vaginal candidosis: comparison between single-dose oral fluconazole and three-day treatment with local miconazole.

Fluconazole is an effective, simple and safe, although slightly expensive, agent for the treatment of vaginal candidosis. Single-dose fluconazole (150 mg) administered orally in capsule form was compared with three-day local treatment with miconazole pessaries in the treatment of vaginal candidosis in a randomized study in Finland. Cure rates were good (> 80%) in randomized patient groups assessed both clinically and by the results of yeast cultures. Oral administration was preferred to local therapy by patients in both the miconazole and fluconazole groups. For the time being, fluconazole is not recommended for use during pregnancy or lactation.
