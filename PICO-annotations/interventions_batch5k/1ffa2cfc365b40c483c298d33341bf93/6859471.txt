Postoperative dreaming. A comparison of the incidence following pentazocine and morphine premedication.

The incidence of postoperative dreaming following the use of morphine and pentazocine as premedicants in an otherwise standard anaesthetic sequence is compared in healthy volunteers. No statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the two drugs. The causes of psychotomimetic problems in the postoperative period and the difficulty of precise definition of hallucinations are discussed.
