Effect of beta-blocking drugs on beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in hypertensive non-diabetic patients.

The effects of two beta-blocking drugs on endogenous insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were investigated in a double-blind cross-over study in 13 hypertensive patients. The patients were randomly allocated to each of three 2-week treatment periods with propranolol 80 mg b.i.d., atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. and placebo b.i.d. Endogenous insulin secretion was assessed by measuring serum insulin and C-peptide before and 6 min after iv administration of glucagon; insulin sensitivity was determined by measuring insulin binding to erythrocytes, and as the glucose disappearance rate (KITT) after i.v. insulin. Fasting concentrations of serum free fatty acids (S-FFA) and plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide (P-GIP) were also recorded during the three study periods. Both propranolol and atenolol reduced blood pressure, heart rate and S-FFA concentrations compared to placebo, and all patients showed measurable plasma concentrations of propranolol and atenolol. The results can be considered representative, therefore, of clinical beta-blockade. The two drugs did not significantly influence the fasting blood glucose level. There was an increase in fasting and glucagon-stimulated serum C-peptide concentration during propranolol therapy compared with placebo (p = 0.037 and p = 0.030, respectively), although this was not reflected by a significant change in serum insulin. Propranolol and atenolol did not significantly influence insulin binding to erythrocytes, but they clearly reduced the glucose disappearance rate KITT was compared to placebo (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.0003), respectively). The findings support the view that beta-blocking drugs can influence glucose metabolism by mechanisms other than inhibition of endogenous insulin secretion.
