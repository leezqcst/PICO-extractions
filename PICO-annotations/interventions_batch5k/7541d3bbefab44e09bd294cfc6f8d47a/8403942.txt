[The effect of indobufen on aortocoronary bypass patency after 1 week and after 1 year].

A randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the effect of "conventional" antiaggregation therapy (ASA plus dipyridamole) versus indobufen in patients after aortocoronary bypass (ACB) surgery. The patency of venous ACB using coronary DSA one week and one year after surgery was evaluated in 52 patients divided into two groups. The study included only ACB's with intraoperative blood flow rates < or = 40 ml/min as it is just these ACB's which are at the highest risk of early and late occlusions. While, in the ASA plus dipyridamole-treated group, occlusions were found in 11 of the 39 reconstructions (28.2%), the proportion was nine out of 37 procedures (24.3%) in the indobufen group. One year after surgery, occlusion was found in 14 out of 32 ACB's (43.7%) in the ASA plus dipyridamole group compared to 14 occlusions in 31 ACB's (45.2%) in the indobufen group. The difference in the number of occlusions between the two groups was not statistically significant. Because of some benefits of indobufen compared to ASA (shorter time of effect, superior tolerance in patients with ulceration), the former drug can be recommended for use in some indicated cases.
