No effect of acetylsalicylic acid on B-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 plasma levels in patients with transient ischaemic attacks.

We studied the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus placebo on B-thromboglobulin (B-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) plasma levels and ADP-induced platelet aggregation in 25 male patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). The patients were allocated randomly to two groups: 14 patients received oral treatment with ASA 500 mg b.i.d. for 14 days, 11 patients placebo b.i.d. for the same period. B-TG and PF4 plasma levels and ADP-induced platelet aggregation were determined in basal conditions, and two hours, and seven and fourteen days after starting with ASA or placebo. In addition, the same parameters were studied in a group of 20 healthy males of matched age. Basal levels of plasma B-TG and PF4 and the maximal amplitude of ADP-induced platelet aggregation were abnormally high in TIA patients. ASA caused a significant reduction of B-TG plasma levels in TIA patients 2 hours after the first administration, but no effect was observed at the 7th and 14th day of treatment. PF4 plasma levels were unaffected by ASA treatment. It is concluded that ASA, at the dose conventionally used in clinical trials, does not affect the release of two alpha-granule proteins.
