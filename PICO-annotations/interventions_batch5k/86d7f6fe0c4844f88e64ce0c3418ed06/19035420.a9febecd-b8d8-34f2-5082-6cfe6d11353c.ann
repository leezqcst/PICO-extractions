T1	Intervention 248 1050	We performed a 4-week randomized controlled trial among 33 RA patients with wrist arthritis. Patients were randomly allocated to the splinting group (n = 17) or the control group (n = 16). Patients in the splinting group received a prefabricated wrist working splint and were instructed to use this splint as much as possible during the day. The primary outcome measure was average wrist pain during the past week, measured using a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures were grip strength and functional ability. The latter was measured using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire and the short version of the Sequential Occupational Dexterity Assessment. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 4 weeks. Performance tests were performed without splint
