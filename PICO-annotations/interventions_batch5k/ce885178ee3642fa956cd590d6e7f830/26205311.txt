Multiorgan protection of remote ischemic perconditioning in valve replacement surgery.

BACKGROUND Remote ischemic perconditioning (RIPerc) is a new alternative of remote ischemic conditioning and has not been well studied. RIPerc attenuates myocardial injury when applied during cardiac surgery. However, its protective effects on other organs remain unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with rheumatic heart disease undergoing valve replacement surgery were randomized into the RIPerc group (n = 101) or the control group (n = 100). RIPerc was achieved by three cycles of 5-min ischemia-5-min reperfusion in the right thigh during surgery. Clinical data and the levels of injury biomarkers for the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys within 48 h after surgery were compared using one-way or repeated measurement analysis of variance.
RESULTS In the RIPerc group, the release of serum cardiac troponin I (128.68 ± 102.56 versus 172.33 ± 184.38, P = 0.04) and the inotropic score (96.4 ± 73.8 versus 121.5 ± 89.6, P = 0.032) decreased compared with that of the control; postoperative drainage (458.2 ± 264.2 versus 545.1 ± 349.0 ml, P = 0.048) and the incidence of acute lung injury was reduced (36.6% versus 51%, P = 0.04), and the extent of hyperbilirubinemia was also attenuated. No significant difference was observed in the levels of biomarkers for renal injury and systemic inflammation response.
CONCLUSIONS RIPerc applied during the valve replacement surgery induced multiple beneficial effects postoperatively including reduced drainage and myocardial damage, lower incidence of acute lung injury, and attenuated hyperbilirubinemia.
