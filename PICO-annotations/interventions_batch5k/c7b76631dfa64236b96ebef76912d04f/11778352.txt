Physical activity in first-degree relatives of breast cancer patients.

This study sought to evaluate physical activity in women at moderate risk for breast cancer, the correlates of engaging in regular physical activity, and whether physical activity relates to psychological well-being. The results revealed that 55% of women were regularly active. Logistic regression models indicated that positive affect was associated with increased and negative affect was associated with decreased overall and leisure activity. Older, married, and employed women were more likely to engage in household/occupational activity, whereas women who perceived their risk for breast cancer as high were less likely. More educated women and those with higher perceived risk were more likely to engage in leisure activity, and married women were less likely. These results suggest a need to increase activity levels in women at moderate risk for breast cancer, provide variables upon which interventions can be tailored to promote activity, and point to psychological benefits of activity in this population.
