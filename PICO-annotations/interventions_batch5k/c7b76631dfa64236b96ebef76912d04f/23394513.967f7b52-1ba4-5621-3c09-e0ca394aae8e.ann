T1	Intervention 256 847	This study was designed to check whether the skin wheal and flare reaction produced by the intradermal injection of autologous serum (AS) and by histamine differs in AH-resistant and AH responder CIU patients. CIU patients with treatment failure under fexofenadine at 180 mg q.d. increased their daily dose of AH to 4 tablets daily. Those with significant improvement of urticaria activity score under fexofenadine at 180 mg were included in the CIU group. Subjects with treatment failure despite a full 8-week fourfold fexofenadine treatment were included in the resistant CIU (R-CIU group)
