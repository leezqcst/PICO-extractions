Cardiac failure: symptoms and functional status.

The associations between exercise capacity, symptoms and specific aspects of quality of life were examined in subjects participating in a trial of the treatment of heart failure. Patients were assessed on entry and after three months treatment. The principle symptoms were fatigue, breathlessness and chest pain. These limited the extent and speed of physical activities, restricted social, leisure and family life and were associated with emotional distress. There were associations between baseline exercise capacity and measures of quality of life. Change in exercise capacity during three months treatment was correlated with changes in measures of symptoms, limitation of activity and quality of life. The findings confirm the value of change in exercise capacity as a measure of functional status and suggest that it should be supported by a limited number of specific measures of quality of life.
