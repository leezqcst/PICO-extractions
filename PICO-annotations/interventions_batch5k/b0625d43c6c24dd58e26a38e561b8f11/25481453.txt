Lifetime history of heroin use is associated with greater drug severity among prescription opioid abusers.

BACKGROUND While research suggests primary prescription opioid (PO) abusers may exhibit less severe demographic and drug use characteristics than primary heroin abusers, less is known about whether a lifetime history of heroin use confers greater severity among PO abusers.
OBJECTIVE In this secondary analysis, we examined demographic and drug use characteristics as a function of lifetime heroin use among 89 PO-dependent adults screened for a trial evaluating the relative efficacy of buprenorphine taper durations. Exploratory analyses also examined contribution of lifetime heroin use to treatment response among a subset of participants who received a uniform set of study procedures.
METHODS Baseline characteristics were compared between participants reporting lifetime heroin use â‰¥5 (H(+); n=41) vs. <5 (H(-); n=48) times. Treatment response (i.e., illicit opioid abstinence and treatment retention at end of study) was examined in the subset of H(+) and H(-) participants randomized to receive the 4-week taper condition (N=22).
RESULTS H(+) participants were significantly older and more likely to be male. They reported longer durations of illicit opioid use, greater alcohol-related problems, more past-month cocaine use, greater lifetime IV drug use, and greater lifetime use of cigarettes, amphetamines and hallucinogens. H(+) participants also had lower scores on the Positive Symptom Distress and Depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Finally, there was a trend toward poorer treatment outcomes among H(+) participants.
CONCLUSION A lifetime history of heroin use may be associated with elevated drug severity and unique treatment needs among treatment-seeking PO abusers.
