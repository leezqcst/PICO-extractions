Optimized strategy for detection of early stage, curable prostate cancer: role of prescreening with prostate-specific antigen.

In 1,002 men aged 45-80 y, 81% of the cancers detectable by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) were present in a subpopulation (19% of total) identified by serum PSA above the threshold value of 3.0 micrograms/L. This study was extended to 7,350 men using serum PSA and DRE as first approach, followed by TRUS only when 1 of these 2 tests was abnormal. Because the aim of prostate cancer detection is to find cancers at an early, potentially curable stage, it is of major interest that 71.8% of evaluable cancers were clinical stage B; 8.4% and 10.7% were stages C1 and C2, respectively; only 9.2% were stage D (metastatic) at first visit while none was at stage D at follow-up visits. This study, the first performed in an unselected, unscreened population, shows that serum PSA is the most sensitive technique to identify men at high risk of having prostate cancer and that 12% more cancers can be found at first visit by doing DRE in addition to PSA. Follow-ups can be done every second year using serum PSA alone, as 97% of the cancers detected at annual follow-up by DRE + PSA were PSA+. Cancers are discovered by the present approach at an estimated cost of $2,665 per cancer. Such cancers are potentially curable in at least 80% of cases detected at first visit and in 97% of cases at follow-up. This strategy offers the possibility to improve markedly morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer, presently the second leading cause of cancer death in North American men.
