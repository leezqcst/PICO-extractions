Participants 128 416 5
In 1,002 men aged 45-80 y, 81% of the cancers detectable by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) were present in a subpopulation (19% of total) identified by serum PSA above the threshold value of 3.0 micrograms/L
Participants 418 556 5
This study was extended to 7,350 men using serum PSA and DRE as first approach, followed by TRUS only when 1 of these 2 tests was abnormal
