Moist Exposed Burn Ointment (MEBO) in partial thickness burns - a randomized, comparative open mono-center study on the efficacy of dermaheal (MEBO) ointment on thermal 2nd degree burns compared to conventional therapy.

OBJECTIVE Wound healing in burn wounds presents a challenge in healthcare, and there is still a lack of alternatives in topical burn wound treatments. - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new therapeutic ointment (MEBO) in the treatment of partial thickness burns.
METHODS 40 patients received either topical treatment with Moist Exposed Burn Ointment (MEBO) or standard Flammazine treatment. All patients suffered from partial-thickness burn injuries (< 20% TBSA). Wounds were evaluated for 60 up to days regarding wound healing, water loss, inflammation, and pain alleviation.
RESULTS For transepidermal water loss, there was a difference of 2.3 gr/m2/h between MEBO, and Flammazine, favoring MEBO. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.78). For all secondary efficacy parameter results were similar. -
CONCLUSIONS This study showed that MEBO ointment for topical treatment of burn injuries presents an attractive alternative for the topical treatment of limited partial thickness thermal burns.
