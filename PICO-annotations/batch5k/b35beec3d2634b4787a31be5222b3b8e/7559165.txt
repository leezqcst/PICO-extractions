A two-filter model for frequency discrimination.

In this paper, we explore a two-filter model, the simplest version of multi-channel models for frequency discrimination of simple tones. According to this model, frequency discrimination is based on a change in the relative output levels of two auditory filters, one centered below and the other above the frequency of the tone. This idea can explain the experimental results that frequency discrimination is relatively unaffected by randomization of stimulus level. Moreover, it suggests a close relationship between the ability of listeners to perform frequency discrimination of simple tones and spectral-shape discrimination of two-tone complexes. The ability of three listeners to perform these two tasks was measured at six frequencies (from 0.25 to 8 kHz). The results from the spectral-shape-discrimination task were used to predict frequency-difference limens. There was a high correlation between obtained and predicted values.
