Long-term quality of life measures after functional endoscopic sinus surgery.

BACKGROUND Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease that has a significant impact on quality of life (QOL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the longer-term effects of combined medical and surgical therapy for CRS on overall health status and QOL.
METHODS We used a prospective study that utilized the Short-Form 36 Survey at baseline presentation and at a mean time of 3 years post-functional endoscopic sinus surgery to assess the general health status of patients who presented for their initial visitfrom 1996 to 1998. Of the 200 randomly selected patients, 150 respondents completed follow-up surveys (a 75% response rate).
RESULTS Eighty-nine (59.3%) women and 61 (40.7%) men were included in the study. Baseline QOL scores indicated significant differences between patients with CRS and published norms in 6/8 subscale parameters (role physical, bodily pain, general health, social function, vitality, and mental health). Significant improvement in all six categories was maintained at the end of the study period (p < 0.05) with QOL scores within limits of published norms for the general population.
CONCLUSION Our data indicate that functional endoscopic sinus surgery, combined with appropriate postoperative care, is effective at maintaining a significant improvement in the overall general health status of patients for at least 3 years after surgical intervention and that the overall scores return to a range of normative values for the general population.
