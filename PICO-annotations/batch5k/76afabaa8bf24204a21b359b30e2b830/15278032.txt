[Tension-free laparoscopic versus open inguinal hernia repair].

AIM During the last decade laparoscopic techniques have been applied to the treatment of inguinal hernia to combine tension-free technique, esthetic, and functional benefits of mini-invasive surgery. Anyway controversy persists regarding the most effective inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this study is to compare the open technique and the laparoscopic approach concerning: complications, recurrences, recovery time and return to usual activity.
METHODS A randomized prospective analysis of 121 consecutive inguinal hernia repairs was performed over a 12-month period. Male well-informed patients with primary monolateral inguinal hernia (ASA I-II) were divided into 2 groups and consecutively treated; group A was treated with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach (TAPP) (median age 47+/-7 years, 57 patients), group B with open mesh herniorrhaphy (45+/-6 years, 64 patients).
RESULTS Complication rate was 5.26% for group A (none needed conversion) and 4.68% for group B. All complications were considered minor. No recurrences were observed over a 12-month follow-up in both groups. Post-operative hospital stay and return to activity show statistically significant differences. Median post-hospital stay was 1.7 days for group A while it was longer (2.9 days) for group B. Significant difference was observed in the duration of convalescence too (group A 9.3+/-7.2 days; group B 12.1+/-7. 1 days).
CONCLUSION On the basis of our experience, even if a longer follow-up is needed, the validity of laparoscopic approach to inguinal hernia is confirmed. General anesthesia and higher costs are reasonable compromises for a shorter period of discomfort in patients with a low ASA index and busy job/sport activity.
