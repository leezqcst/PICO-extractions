Short-term metformin treatment for clomiphene citrate-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a short-course pretreatment with metformin on hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, cervical scores, and pregnancy rates in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS Thirty-seven women with CC-resistant PCOS were randomly assigned to be pretreated with 500 mg of metformin or placebo 3 times per day for 2 cycles, and 100 mg of CC was given on days 5 through 9 of the second cycle in both groups. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), dehydroepiandrostendione sulfate (DHEAS), total testosterone (T), glucose, and insulin levels were measured at baseline and after the first cycle, as well as body mass index (BMI), cervical score, and pregnancy rate.
RESULTS After 1 cycle, BMI, total T level, and percentage of participants with insulin resistance were significantly decreased in the metformin group, without any significant decrease in LH, FSH, and DHEAS levels; and in the second cycle, CC treatment resulted in a higher ovulation rate and a thicker endometrium in the metformin group. The pregnancy rate and cervical scores were also higher in that group.
CONCLUSION The short-course pretreatment with metformin decreased hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance and improved cervical sores, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate among women with CC-resistant PCOS.
