OBJECTIVE To observe clinical therapeutic effect of acupuncture combined with Yizhi Jiannao Granules for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and its effects on intelligence, daily life and social activity ability.
METHODS Eighty-four cases were randomly divided into 3 groups, 28 cases in each group. The combined acupuncture and medication group was treated with acupuncture at Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Dazhui (GV 14), Guanyuan (CV 4), etc. and oral administration of Yizhi Jiannao Granules; the Chinese herb group was treated with Yizhi Jiannao Granules, and the western medicine group with oral administration of Aricept. The scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Ability of Daily Life (ADL) and the therapeutic effects were assessed and compared before treatment and after treatment for 12 weeks among the groups.
RESULTS After treatment, the scores for MMSE and ADL were improved in the combined acupuncture and medication group, the Chinese herb group and the western medicine group, which were better in the combined acupuncture and medication group (P < 0.05). The total effective rate of 85.7% in the combined acupuncture and medication group was better than 71.4% in the Chinese herb group and 67.9% in the western medicine group.
CONCLUSION Acupuncture combined with Yizhi Jiannao Granules has a significant therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease, which is better than that of Yizhi Jiannao Granules or Aricept.
