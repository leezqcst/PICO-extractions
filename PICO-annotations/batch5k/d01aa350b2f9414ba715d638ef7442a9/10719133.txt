Blood pressure biofeedback treatment of white-coat hypertension.

OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to compare blood pressure (BP) biofeedback treatment (BF) effects between white-coat hypertension and essential hypertension.
METHODS Fifteen white-coat hypertensive out-patients and 23 essential hypertensive out-patients were randomly assigned to groups A or B. Subjects in group A underwent BF once a week for a total of four sessions. Those in group B visited the clinic only to measure BP and later underwent the same BF.
RESULTS In group A, BPs of white-coat hypertensives and essential hypertensives were significantly reduced by 22/11 and 14/8 mmHg, respectively. In group B, they were unchanged during the same period but later suppressed by BF. Under BF, pulse and respiratory rates were significantly higher, and elevation of diastolic BP due to mental stress testing was better suppressed in white-coat hypertensives than in essential hypertensives.
CONCLUSION This treatment was effective in both types of hypertension, and pressor response to stress seems to be important in the differentiated BF effect.
