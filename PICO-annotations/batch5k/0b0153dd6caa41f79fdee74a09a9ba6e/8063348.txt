Effects of short-term isotonic & isometric training on cardiovascular & pulmonary function.

A randomised control trial of short-term exercises on specific cardiovascular and respiratory parameters was undertaken in normal male college students. The effects of isotonic training (5BX programme) and isometric training (a programme of isometric exercises working all major groups of muscles) were compared with a control group with no specific workout. Both isotonic and isometric training resulted in significant cardiovascular improvement but seemed inadequate to improve vital capacity and flow rates. Isotonic training in addition, improved ventilatory efficiency. It is concluded that such isotonic or isometric training of thrice a week for ten weeks, requiring no equipment, less time and space can be promoted to improve physical fitness.
