Torasemide in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

The effects of torasemide (20 mg/day) and furosemide (50 mg/day), each given over 4 days, were compared in a randomized and crossover study carried out in seven patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites. Patients also received a low-sodium (40 mmol/day) diet and the aldosterone antagonist, potassium canrenoate (100 mg b.i.d.). Torasemide induced a remarkably higher natriuretic (120 +/- 15 vs. 33 +/- 6 mmol/day, p < 0.02) and diuretic (1450 +/- 63 vs. 900 +/- 58 ml, p < 0.005) effect than furosemide. Body weight loss was also significantly higher (2.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 0.2 +/- 1.3 kg, p < 0.01) during the torasemide period. Kaliuresis was similar during the two treatment periods, despite the striking differences observed in natriuresis. Neither torasemide nor furosemide induced any significant change in serum electrolyte or creatinine concentrations, or in ammonia levels. The results of this study indicate that torasemide is suitable for the treatment of sodium retention in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
