Single-dose tranexamic acid reduces postoperative bleeding after coronary surgery in patients treated with aspirin until surgery.

UNLABELLED Tranexamic acid reduces postoperative bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting. We evaluated the effects of a single dose of tranexamic acid given immediately before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients treated with aspirin until the day before surgery. The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Eighty patients were included and divided into two groups: one group received tranexamic acid 30 mg/kg, and one group received placebo (0.9% NaCl) as a bolus injection before CPB. Postoperative blood loss was recorded for 16 h. Transfusions of blood products were recorded for the whole hospital stay. Transfusions of packed red cells were given when the hematocrit value was less than 20% during CPB and less than 25% after surgery. The patients in the tranexamic acid group had significantly less postoperative bleeding compared with the patients in the placebo group (mean [SD]) (475 [274] mL versus 713 [243] mL; P < 0.001). An effective inhibition of fibrinolysis was found in patients receiving tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid reduces postoperative bleeding in coronary artery bypass grafting patients treated with aspirin until the day before surgery.
IMPLICATIONS Continuation of aspirin medication until the day before coronary artery bypass grafting may increase postoperative bleeding. The administration of a single dose of tranexamic acid (30 mg/kg) immediately before cardiopulmonary bypass significantly reduced postoperative bleeding and inhibited fibrinolysis in these patients.
