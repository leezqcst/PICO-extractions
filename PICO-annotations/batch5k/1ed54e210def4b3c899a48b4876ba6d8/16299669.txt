Comparative speed of kill of selamectin, imidacloprid, and fipronil-(S)-methoprene spot-on formulations against fleas on cats.

The speed of kill of selamectin, imidacloprid, and fipronil-(S)-methoprene against Ctenocephalides felis infestations on cats for one month following a single treatment was evaluated. Eighty cats were randomly allocated so that there were 20 cats in four different treatment groups. On Days -2, 7, 14, 21, and 28, each cat was infested with 100 adult C. felis from the Kansas 1 flea strain. Following initial application only imidacloprid had caused a significant reduction in adult fleas on treated cats within 6 hours, but by 24 hours all three formulations had killed 96.7% of the fleas. At 7 days post treatment, all three formulations reduced flea populations within 6 and 24 hours by 68.4% and 99.4%, respectively. At 21 and 28 days after treatment, none of the formulations killed significant numbers of fleas as compared to controls within 6 hours of infestation. At 28 days after treatment, selamectin, fipronil-(S)-methoprene, and imidacloprid had killed 99.0%, 86.4%, and 72.6% of the fleas within 48 hours of infestation, respectively. This study demonstrates that the speed of kill of residual flea products on cats decreases throughout the month following application. It also demonstrated that selamectin provided the highest level of residual activity on cats against the Kansas 1 flea strain.
