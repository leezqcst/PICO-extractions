Sustained oral health improvement and use of toothbrushes and dentifrice by previous users of traditional materials in a rural population in Andhra Pradesh, India.

AIM To follow-up, one year later, a double-blind, randomised study, which investigated the effect of regular brushing with dentifrices on the oral health of an economically disadvantaged rural population in Andhra Pradesh, India who were primarily users of traditional materials.
SUBJECTS 150 of the original study population.
METHOD Examination to determine whether the improvements in oral health status and oral health behaviour (use of toothbrush and dentifrice), being unsupported, had been sustained since completion of the original study.
RESULTS Data analysis showed sustained, statistically significant improvements in gingival health as measured by gingival bleeding and plaque indices (GBI and PI) comparing users and non-users of toothbrushes and dentifrice in the original study (PI: p = 0.04; GBI: p = 0.03) and sustained use of toothbrushes and dentifrice by 60% of the subjects at follow-up one year later.
CONCLUSIONS This study shows a beneficial effect on oral hygiene indices following the introduction of toothbrushes and dentifrices to a community using traditional oral hygiene materials and sustainability of use of these materials with motivation and support. It may therefore be concluded that it is feasible to achieve significant use of conventional toothbrushes and toothpastes, with consequent major and sustained improvements in plaque control and gingival health in a disadvantaged population hitherto often considered as not amenable to conventional oral hygiene for cultural or economic reasons.
