T1	Participants 1649 1879	CONCLUSION Combined MDM2 and Ki-67 expression levels were independently related to distant metastasis and mortality and, if validated, could be considered for risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer in clinical trials
T2	Participants 1114 1388	Results In multivariate analyses that adjusted for all markers and treatment covariates, MDM2 overexpression was significantly related to DM (P = .02) and OM (P = .003), and Ki-67 overexpression was significantly related to DM (P < .0001), CSM (P = .0007), and OM (P = .01).
T3	Participants 607 738	PATIENTS AND METHODS Adequate tissue for immunohistochemistry was available for p53, Ki-67, and MDM2 analyses in 478 patient cases.
T4	Participants 152 226	PURPOSE MDM2 regulates p53, which controls cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
