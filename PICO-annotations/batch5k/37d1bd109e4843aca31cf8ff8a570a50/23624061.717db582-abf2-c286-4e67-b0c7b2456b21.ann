T1	Participants 1487 1691	We conclude that postural responses to backward and forward perturbations may be processed by different neural circuits, with influence of startle pathways on postural responses to backward perturbations.
T2	Participants 186 284	we investigate the possible influence of a startling auditory stimulus (SAS) on postural responses
T3	Participants 640 755	Balance was perturbed in 11 healthy participants by a movable platform that suddenly translated forward or backward
T4	Participants 959 1017	Perturbation trials were interspersed with SAS-only trials
