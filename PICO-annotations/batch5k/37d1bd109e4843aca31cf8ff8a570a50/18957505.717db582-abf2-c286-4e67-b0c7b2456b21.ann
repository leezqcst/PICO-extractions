T1	Participants 1899 1980	CONCLUSION Vildagliptin improves islet function in T2DM under fasting conditions.
T2	Participants 1441 1547	RESULTS There were small and comparable reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin in both groups over 3 months
T3	Participants 736 845	OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to examine the effects of DPP-4 inhibition on fasting islet function
T4	Participants 1019 1170	SUBJECTS Forty-one subjects with T2DM were treated with metformin or diet, having good glycemic control with glycosylated hemoglobin values of 6.2-7.5%
T5	Participants 137 401	CONTEXT Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are proposed to lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by prolonging the activity of the circulating incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
