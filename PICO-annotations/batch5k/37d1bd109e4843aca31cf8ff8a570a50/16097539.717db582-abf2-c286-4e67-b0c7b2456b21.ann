T1	Participants 1306 1451	INTERPRETATION Pressurization of the cement produced better cement penetration and increased the cup stability in terms of changes in inclination
T2	Participants 840 926	RESULTS The pressurized group of THAs was more stable regarding changes in inclination
T3	Participants 414 617	PATIENTS AND METHODS We randomized 50 THAs to either fingerpacking or sequential pressurization (including individual pressurization of each anchorage hole) and followed the patients with RSA for 5 years
T4	Participants 162 235	BACKGROUND Cementing technique is a crucial factor in prosthesis fixation
T5	Participants 0 159	Migration of the acetabular component: effect of cement pressurization and significance of early radiolucency: a randomized 5-year study using radiostereometry
