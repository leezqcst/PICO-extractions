[Hepatoprotective activity of remaxol in patients with chronic hepatic disorders].

This milticentre randomized clinical study of the efficiency of remaxol infusion solution (hepatoprotective medicine for chronic liver dysfunction) included 494 patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. 294 of them staying in 7 clinics were given remaxol and 200 ones received placebo. Randomization was achieved by the envelope method. A detailed description of clinical and laboratory characteristics of the diseases is presented. Effects of remaxol vs placebo on the functional activity of affected liver are discussed. Results of laboratory and clinical analysis indicate that mechanism of remaxol action is based on hepatoprotective, antioxidative, and anticholestatic activities of the drug.
