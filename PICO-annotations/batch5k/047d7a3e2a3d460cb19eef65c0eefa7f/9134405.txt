A randomised trial evaluating pain and bleeding after a first trimester miscarriage treated surgically or medically.

Miscarriage treated surgically and medically were compared in a randomised controlled trial evaluating pain and bleeding. Surgery is associated with less pain (P < 0.03) and vaginal bleeding (duration and severity, P = 0.001) than medical treatment, fewer daily hospital attendances (2.5 compared with three, P = 0.04) but a greater drop in haemoglobin concentration (difference, 1 g/dl; CI95% = 0.3-1.6).
