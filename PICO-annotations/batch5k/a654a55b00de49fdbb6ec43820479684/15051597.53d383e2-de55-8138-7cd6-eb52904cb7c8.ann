T1	Participants 0 63	LDL cholesterol-raising effect of low-dose docosahexaenoic acid
T2	Participants 67 92	middle-aged men and women
T3	Participants 199 250	effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are uncertain
T4	Participants 293 382	to determine the effect on blood lipids of a daily intake of 0.7 g DHA as triacylglycerol
T5	Participants 598 707	increased the DHA concentration in plasma by 76% (P < 0.0001) and the proportion in erythrocyte lipids by 58%
T6	Participants 1126 1206	Plasma lathosterol and plant sterol concentrations were unaffected by treatment.
T7	Participants 1218 1320	A daily intake of approximately 0.7 g DHA increases LDL cholesterol by 7% in middle-aged men and women
T8	Participants 1343 1396	DHA down-regulates the expression of the LDL receptor
