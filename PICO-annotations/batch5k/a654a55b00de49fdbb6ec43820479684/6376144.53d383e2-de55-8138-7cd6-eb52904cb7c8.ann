T8	Participants 739 819	Asymptomatic days were relatively infrequent and daily drug consumption was high
T9	Participants 848 980	the cross-over periods showed flow-rate values close to normal, with an increase in residual volume and functional residual capacity
T10	Participants 1113 1253	oxitropium bromide treatment were significantly better than the run-in values (p less than 0.005) and the placebo period (p less than 0.02).
T11	Participants 1289 1315	non-trial drug consumption
T12	Participants 1335 1473	showed no difference in terms of flow rate, although oxitropium did cause a significant improvement in the RV/TLC ratio (p less than 0.05)
