Cryotherapy does not affect peroneal reaction following sudden inversion.

CONTEXT If ankle joint cryotherapy impairs the ability of the ankle musculature to counteract potentially injurious forces, the ankle is left vulnerable to injury.
OBJECTIVE To compare peroneal reaction to sudden inversion following ankle joint cryotherapy.
DESIGN Repeated measures design with independent variables, treatment (cryotherapy and control), and time (baseline, immediately post treatment, 15 minutes post treatment, and 30 minutes post treatment).
SETTING University research laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Twenty-seven healthy volunteers.
INTERVENTION(S) An ice bag was secured to the lateral ankle joint for 20 minutes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The onset and average root mean square amplitude of EMG activity in the peroneal muscles was calculated following the release of a trap door mechanism causing inversion.
RESULTS There was no statistically significant change from baseline for peroneal reaction time or average peroneal muscle activity at any post treatment time.
CONCLUSIONS Cryotherapy does not affect peroneal muscle reaction following sudden inversion perturbation.
