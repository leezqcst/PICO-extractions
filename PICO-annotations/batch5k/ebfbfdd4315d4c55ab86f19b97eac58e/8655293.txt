Pentoxifylline therapy in HIV seropositive subjects with elevated TNF.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is thought to induce cachexia in subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has been suggested that HIV-seropositive patients would benefit from treatment with pentoxifylline, a known suppressor of TNF-alpha production. The purpose of the present study was to examine how pentoxifylline at a dose of 800 mg thrice daily would influence the cellular immune system in HIV-seropositive persons with elevated TNF-alpha. Six HIV-seropositive subjects with elevated amounts of TNF-alpha in plasma at least at two occasions were included in an open, controlled, randomized, cross-over study consisting of a 6 week treatment period and a 6 week control period. Blood samples were collected before and at the end of each period. Pentoxifylline treatment did not influence the concentration of plasma-TNF-alpha, subpopulations of blood mononuclear cells, the proliferative responses nor the natural killer (NK), and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell activities. Furthermore, pentoxifylline treatment did not influence the weight, temperature, well being, or tiredness of the subjects. However, the patients frequently reported gastrointestinal side effects. In vitro, however, pentoxifylline at suprapharmacological concentrations inhibited the blood mononuclear cell (BMNC) proliferative responses, NK, and LAK cell activities.
