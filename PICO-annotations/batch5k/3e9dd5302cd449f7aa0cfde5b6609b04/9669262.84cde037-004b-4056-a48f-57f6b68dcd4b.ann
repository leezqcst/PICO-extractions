T1	Participants 1805 1954	CONCLUSIONS Pravastatin led to significant early reduction of a wide range of cardiovascular events in post-MI women with average cholesterol levels.
T2	Participants 1119 1351	RESULTS Women treated with pravastatin had a risk reduction of 43% for the primary end point (p = 0.035), 46% for combined coronary events (p = 0.001), 48% for PTCA (p = 0.025), 40% for CABG (p = 0.14) and 56% for stroke (p = 0.07).
T3	Participants 517 857	METHODS In the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial, 576 postmenopausal women, between 3 and 20 months after MI, with a total cholesterol level <240 mg/dl and a low density lipoprotein cholesterol level 115 to 174 mg/dl, were randomized to receive pravastatin 40 mg/day or matching placebo for a median follow-up period of 5 years.
T4	Participants 137 306	OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the effect of pravastatin on recurrent cardiovascular events in women with average cholesterol levels after myocardial infarction (MI).
T5	Participants 307 516	BACKGROUND Little information is available on the effectiveness of lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women; in particular, those with CHD and average cholesterol levels.
