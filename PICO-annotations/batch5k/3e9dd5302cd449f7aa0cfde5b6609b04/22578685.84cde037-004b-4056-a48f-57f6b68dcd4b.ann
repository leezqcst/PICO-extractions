T1	Participants 1867 2004	CONCLUSIONS Carbon dioxide pericardial insufflation in open-chamber cardiac surgery does not affect postoperative neurocognitive decline.
T2	Participants 868 955	RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients underwent surgery and were randomly allocated.
T3	Participants 559 867	METHODS A multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial compared neurocognitive outcomes in patients undergoing open-chamber (left-sided) cardiac surgery who were assigned carbon dioxide insufflation or placebo (control group) in addition to standardized mechanical deairing maneuvers.
T4	Participants 131 558	OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were first to analyze neurocognitive outcomes of patients after open-chamber cardiac surgery to determine whether carbon dioxide pericardial insufflation reduces incidence of neurocognitive decline (primary end point) as measured 6 weeks postoperatively and second to assess the utility of carbon dioxide insufflation in cardiac chamber deairing as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography.
