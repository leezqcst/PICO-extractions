Blind versus open approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized study.

Intraabdominal structures may be damaged during blind introduction of the first trocar for laparoscopic operations. In this study, 150 patients with gallbladder lithiasis who underwent laparoscopy were randomly assigned to two groups, a blind (V group) or an open (H group), in order to compare the results and the rate of complications. No mortality was observed. Major complications occurred in 3/75 (4%) patients of the V group and in 1/75 (1.3%) patient of the H group (p < 0.05). Minor complications occurred in 5/75 (6.7%) patients of either group. The achievement of pneumoperitoneum required 4.5+/-0.4 min in the V group and 3.2+/-0.2 min in the H group (p < 0.05). The open laparoscopic technique is safer and faster than the blind approach; therefore, it is proposed that this approach be routinely used in all laparoscopic procedures.
