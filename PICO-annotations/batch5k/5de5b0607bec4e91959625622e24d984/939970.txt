Radiotherapy and CCNU in the treatment of high-grade supratentorial astrocytomas.

Forty-one consecutive patients with supratentorial primary brain tumors (38 Grade III and IV astrocytomas, one giant-cell astrocytoma, and two cases with insufficient tissue for diagnosis) were randomly allocated within 2 weeks of surgery to one of three therapeutic groups. Group 1 (15 patients) received radiation therapy totaling 4000 to 4500 rads in 4 to 5 weeks. Group 2 (13 patients) received 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea CCNU) 130 mg/sq m orally every 6 weeks. Group 3 (13 patients) received radiation therapy plus CCNU as for Groups 1 and 2. When the disease progressed, patients in Groups 1 and 2 were crossed over to receive CCNU and irradiation respectively. The median survival time in these groups was 188, 259, and 252 days, and the mean survival 263, 262, and 329 days. The median time from diagnosis to crossover (Groups 1 and 2) or to progression (Group 3) was 163, 99, and 220 days, and the mean time was 172, 108, and 231 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the means or medians in any of these situations.
