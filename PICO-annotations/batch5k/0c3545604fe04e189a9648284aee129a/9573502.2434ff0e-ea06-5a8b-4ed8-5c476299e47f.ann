T1	Participants 454 993	The effects of a continuous 4-hour infusion of hBNP were determined in 16 decompensated heart failure patients in an invasive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were evaluated during three 4-hour study periods: baseline, treatment (placebo [n = 4] versus hBNP 0.025 or 0.05 microgram/kg/min [n = 12]), and post-treatment.
