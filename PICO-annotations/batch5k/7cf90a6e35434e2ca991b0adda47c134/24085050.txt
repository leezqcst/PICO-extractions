Pimecrolimus cream and Tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: a pilot study on patient preference.

BACKGROUND Pimecrolimus cream 1% is approved for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children older than two years of age and adults. Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the patient population between two to seventeen years of age and Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients 18 years of age and older. However, beyond safety and efficacy, the delivery system or vehicle used in topical treatment formulations is equally important in affecting patient satisfaction, tolerability, and subsequent treatment compliance and hence clinical resolution of active disease.
