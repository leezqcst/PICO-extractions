Complex decongestive therapy and taping for patients with postmastectomy lymphedema: a randomized controlled study.

PURPOSE The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of Kinesio Taping(®) Application with Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) in patients with lymphedema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 45 patients were randomly divided into 3 groups (CDT including Bandage, CDT including Bandage + Kinesio Tape(®), CDT including Kinesio Tape(®) without bandage). Assessments included the severity of the symptoms such as pain, discomfort, heaviness, tension, stiffness and weakness. Bilateral circumference measurements were done for evaluation of the edema.
RESULTS Symptoms were decreased in all three groups (p < 0.05). CDT was found effective only during treatment in arm volume (p < 0.05). Kinesio Taping(®) applied with CDT had effect of decreasing edema after 10 days of treatment period (p < 0.05) and for control period (p < 0.05). Only the application of Kinesio Taping(®) group also had significant decrease at edema (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION Kinesio Taping(®) Application along with CDT may have a better effect on decreasing lymphedema which can stimulate the reduction of edema for long term effects.
