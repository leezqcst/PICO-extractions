[Pilot results of using tamsulone-FS in patients with prostatic adenoma according to the results of a randomized multicenter comparative trial].

Tamsulone-FS--a novel Russian alpha1A/D-adrenoblocker (Farm-Syntez)--was studied in a randomized multicenter comparative trial in patients with prostatic adenoma. Pilot results agreed with other trials published in the literature and demonstrated tamsulone-FS efficacy and safety for management of lower urinary tract symptoms caused by prostatic adenoma. The efficacy and safety of tamsulone-FS was comparable to those of omnik. This drug can be recommended for wide clinical practice in prostatic adenoma. It is registered by Roszdravnadzor (certificate N LC-000859 of 03.11.2005) and allowed for production and sale.
