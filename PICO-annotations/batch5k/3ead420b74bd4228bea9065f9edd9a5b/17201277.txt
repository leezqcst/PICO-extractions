[The effects of mexicor on thrombocyte aggregation, blood viscosity, hemodynamics, and the clinical course of coronary artery disease].

The authors analyze their experience in the application of mexicor, a Russian cytoprotector, in 50patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) and 51 patients with acute coronary syndrome. In additional to cytoprotective action, the use of mexidor in complex therapy of CAD lowers the functional activity of thrombocytes, eliminates high blood viscosity syndrome, and lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol level. These favorable changes in hemorheological parameters improves myocardial perfusion, lowers the strength and frequency of coronary pain attacks, retards postinfarction left ventricular remodeling, and increases the quality of life of patients with various CAD forms.
