The effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy on platelet and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with metabolic syndrome.

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 15 aspirin-naive patients (mean age 48.8 Â± 10.2 years) with the metabolic syndrome, statin monotherapy (simvastatin 40 mg daily) was compared to combination therapy (simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily) on biomarkers of inflammation and platelet activity. The addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin over a 4-week period was associated with reduced expression of CD141 (thrombomodulin; p = 0.02), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p < 0.0001) and CD51/61 (vitronectin receptor; p = 0.048) compared to statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe added to simvastatin improves several indices of platelet reactivity beyond statin monotherapy. However, the clinical relevance of these findings await results of the IMPROVE-IT trial (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial).
