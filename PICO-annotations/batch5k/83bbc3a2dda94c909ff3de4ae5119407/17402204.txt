[Evaluation on the effect of intervention regarding breast self-examination for decreasing breast cancer mortality].

OBJECTIVE A randomized trial of breast self-examination (BSE) Program was carried out to evaluate whether the intensive BSE could reduce the number of deaths among women from breast cancer.
METHODS This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 266 064 women (age of 30 to 64 years) associated with 519 textile factories in Shanghai had been randomly assigned to a BSE group (132 979 women) or a control group (133 085 women) since 1989. Initial instruction in BSE group would include demonstration of proper palpation techniques and was followed by 2 reinforcement sessions during the subsequent 4 years including video shows, BSE instruction sessions and BSE practice under medical supervision. These activities were continued for 5 years. Attendance at all events was recorded. The cohort was followed through July 2000 for development of breast diseases, and the breast cancer cases were followed through 2001 for vital status. Data analysis methods used would include Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank test and Cox modeling.
RESULTS Among women under instruction, 864 breast cancers detected and 133 breast cancer deaths occurred while 896 breast cancers were detected and 130 deaths recorded in the control group. The tumor size (P = 0.07), TNM stage (P = 0.39) and cumulative breast cancer mortality rate (P = 0.72) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, more and smaller fibroadenomas were detected in the instruction group than in the control group (P< 0.01).
CONCLUSION Intensive instruction in BSE did not seem to have reduced the mortality rate of breast cancer, but more and smaller benign breast lumps could be detected.
