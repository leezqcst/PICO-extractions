The antiemetic efficacy of prophylactic granisetron in gynecologic surgery.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common after recovery from anesthesia. We examined the prophylactic effect of granisetron on postoperative nausea and vomiting in 120 female patients (ASA physical status I) undergoing gynecologic surgery. They were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 40 for each): saline (as a control), granisetron 20 micrograms/kg, and granisetron 40 micrograms/kg. Saline or granisetron was given intravenously (IV) over 5 min approximately 30 min before the end of anesthesia. Nausea, vomiting, and safety assessments were performed during the 24-h recovery period. For the 24-h period after surgery, the number of emesis-free patients was significantly larger in the granisetron groups than in the control group (83%, 78%, and 20% of patients receiving granisetron 20 micrograms/kg and 40 micrograms/kg, and saline, respectively). Granisetron at both doses also was superior to the control for the prevention of nausea over the 24-h study period (nausea visual analog scales at 24-h postsurgery: 49 mm, 17 mm, and 18 mm in the control, granisetron 20 micrograms/kg, and granisetron 40 micrograms/kg groups, respectively). Fewer patients received "rescue" antiemetics in the granisetron groups than in the control group (10%, 10%, and 43% of patients in granisetron 20 micrograms/kg and 40 micrograms/kg, and the control groups, respectively). The adverse events in the granisetron groups were similar to those in the control group. The administration of granisetron had no significant effect on vital signs or clinical laboratory test profiles. Granisetron given at 20 or 40 micrograms/kg i.v. during anesthesia appears to be a simple, effective, and safe method for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.
