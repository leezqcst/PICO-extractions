Study of cytosine arabinoside (NSC-63878) synchronization plus vincristine (NSC-67574), prednisone (NSC-10023), and L-asparaginase (NSC-109229) for remission induction in advanced acute leukemia in children.

Cytosine arabinoside (CA) was utilized in efforts to synchronize leukemic cells in DNA synthesis for treatment with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase in children with acute leukemia in relapse. The results did not indicate any therapeutic advantage for patients treated with this combination compared to those treated without any attempt at CA synchronization.
