T1	Participants 1135 1302	CONCLUSION This trial found that taking 20 mg pravastatin for 2 years had no significant effect on kidney function or urinary protein excretion in patients with ADPKD.
T2	Participants 892 1134	RESULTS There were no significant (p > 0.05) changes in markers of kidney function or urinary protein excretion between groups over the 2 years despite a significant fall in total serum cholesterol in pravastatin-treated patients (p = 0.029).
T3	Participants 404 595	MATERIAL AND METHODS This randomized open-label clinical trial was conducted to assess the effect of pravastatin 20 mg on kidney function and urinary protein excretion in patients with ADPKD.
