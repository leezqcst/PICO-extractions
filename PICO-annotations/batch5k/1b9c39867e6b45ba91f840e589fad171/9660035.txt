Zolmitriptan (311C90) does not interact with fluoxetine in healthy volunteers.

Zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly 311C90) is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B/1D-receptor agonist with central and peripheral activity for the acute treatment of migraine. This randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study investigated the effects of fluoxetine administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolmitriptan. Twenty volunteers were given single doses of fluoxetine 20 mg or an identical placebo daily for 28 days prior to receiving a single 10 mg oral dose of zolmitriptan. Sixteen volunteers completed the two treatment phases. The pharmacokinetic parameters of zolmitriptan and its metabolites were not significantly affected by fluoxetine pretreatment. The pharmacodynamic effects of zolmitriptan were also unaffected by fluoxetine pretreatment. There were small, clinically insignificant increases in blood pressure following zolmitriptan which were unaltered by fluoxetine. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated when given alone or concomitantly with fluoxetine. These results indicate that there is no contraindication to the use of zolmitriptan in patients treated concurrently with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and that no adjustment of the zolmitriptan dose is required in these circumstances.
