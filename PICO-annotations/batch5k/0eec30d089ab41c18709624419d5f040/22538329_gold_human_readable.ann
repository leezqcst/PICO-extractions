determine atheroma progression in patients with spotty calcification.
Participants 618 777 8
A total of 1,347 stable patients with angiographic coronary artery disease underwent serial evaluation of atheroma burden with intravascular ultrasound imaging
Participants 779 928 5
Patients with spotty calcification were identified based on the presence of lesions (1 to 4 mm in length) containing an arc of calcification of <90°

 compared between patients with spotty calcification (n = 922) and those with no calcification (n = 425
Participants 1096 1462 3
 Patients with spotty calcification were older (age 56 years vs. 54 years; p = 0.001), more likely to be male (68% vs. 54%; p = 0.01), and have a history of diabetes mellitus (30% vs. 24%; p = 0.01) and myocardial infarction (28% vs. 20%; p = 0.004), and have lower on-treatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (48 ± 16 mg/dl vs. 51 ± 17 mg/dl; p = 0.0
