T1	Participants 181 249	determine atheroma progression in patients with spotty calcification
T2	Participants 629 692	1,347 stable patients with angiographic coronary artery disease
T3	Participants 779 927	Patients with spotty calcification were identified based on the presence of lesions (1 to 4 mm in length) containing an arc of calcification of <90°
T4	Participants 983 1086	compared between patients with spotty calcification (n = 922) and those with no calcification (n = 425)
T5	Participants 1136 1462	older (age 56 years vs. 54 years; p = 0.001), more likely to be male (68% vs. 54%; p = 0.01), and have a history of diabetes mellitus (30% vs. 24%; p = 0.01) and myocardial infarction (28% vs. 20%; p = 0.004), and have lower on-treatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (48 ± 16 mg/dl vs. 51 ± 17 mg/dl; p = 0.001)
T6	Participants 1514 1673	greater percent atheroma volume (PAV) (36.0 ± 7.6% vs. 29.0 ± 8.5%; p < 0.001) and total atheroma volume (174.6 ± 71.9 mm(3) vs. 133.9 ± 64.9 mm(3); p < 0.001)
