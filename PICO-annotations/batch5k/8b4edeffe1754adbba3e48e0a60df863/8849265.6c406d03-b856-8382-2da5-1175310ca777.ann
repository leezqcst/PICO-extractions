T1	Participants 1482 1692	Our results suggest that the fall in serum G-CSF levels during rhG-CSF therapy may result from increased clearance and/or decreased absorption of rhG-CSF, two processes related to circulating neutrophil counts.
T2	Participants 796 891	Twelve patients were randomly assigned to four groups with different rhG-CSF therapy schedules.
T3	Participants 0 135	Levels of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in serum are inversely correlated with circulating neutrophil counts.
