T1	Participants 1410 1549	CONCLUSIONS Dapsone gel, 5% appears to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for acne vulgaris, with a rapid onset of action.
T2	Participants 648 895	RESULTS Dapsone gel-treated patients achieved superior results in terms of the investigator's global acne assessment (P < .001) and the mean percentage reduction in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total lesion counts (all, P < .001) at week 12.
T3	Participants 421 647	METHODS Patients 12 years of age and older with acne vulgaris (N = 3010) participated in two identically-designed 12-week, randomized, double-blind studies of twice-daily monotherapy with dapsone gel, 5%, versus a vehicle gel.
T4	Participants 299 420	OBJECTIVES The goal of these studies was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapsone gel, 5% in the treatment of acne.
T5	Participants 115 298	BACKGROUND A new aqueous gel formulation of dapsone has been developed that allows clinically-effective doses of dapsone to be administered topically with minimal systemic absorption.
