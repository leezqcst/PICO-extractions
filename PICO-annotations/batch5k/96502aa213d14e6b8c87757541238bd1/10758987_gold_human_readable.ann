At six centers, 71 angiographers each reviewed a set of 100 angiographic sequences. The 100 sequences were divided into four, 25-sequence subsets. Each subset of 25 was displayed either as original images or at one of three compression ratios (CRs) (6:1, 10:1 or 16:1). The effect of lossy compression on the sensitivity and specificity for detection of diagnostic features was determined. The effect of compression on subjective measures of image quality graded by the angiographers was also examined
