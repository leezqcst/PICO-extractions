T1	Participants 0 51	MRI signal hyperintensities in geriatric depression
T2	Participants 141 173	magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
T3	Participants 305 424	discriminate patients with depression from normal subjects and whether they are associated with any clinical variables.
T4	Participants 503 541	MRI brain scans of 48 elderly patients
T5	Participants 581 635	DSM-III-R with the scans of 39 normal elderly subjects
T6	Participants 979 1101	These findings support those of neuroimaging studies implicating the basal ganglia in depression and geriatric depression.
T7	Participants 853 965	patients with similar current ages and cerebrovascular disease risk who had early-onset or late-onset depression
T8	Participants 1174 1286	late-onset depression and MRI hyperintensities is most likely a function of cerebrovascular disease risk and age
