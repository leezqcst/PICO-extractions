Venlafaxine versus clonidine for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients: a double-blind, randomized cross-over study.

PURPOSE Breast cancer patients with treatment-induced menopause experience frequent and severe hot flashes (HF). We compared venlafaxine and clonidine for the treatment of HF with regard to side effects, efficacy, quality of life and sexual functioning.
METHODS In a double-blind, cross-over study, 60 breast cancer patients experiencing HF were randomized to 8 weeks venlafaxine followed by 2 weeks wash-out, and 8 weeks clonidine or vice versa. HF frequency and severity, side effects, quality of life and sexuality were assessed.
RESULTS Thirty patients started with venlafaxine and 30 with clonidine. Premature discontinuation for toxicity occurred in 14/59 during venlafaxine and 5/53 during clonidine (P = .038). Venlafaxine induced more side effects. Median reduction in HF score was 49% for venlafaxine and 55% for clonidine (ns).
CONCLUSION Venlafaxine and clonidine are equally, but moderately effective in HF reduction. Side effects are the main reason for drug discontinuation, occurring more often with venlafaxine.
