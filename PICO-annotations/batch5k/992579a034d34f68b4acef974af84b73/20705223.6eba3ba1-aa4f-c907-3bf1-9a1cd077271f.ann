T1	Participants 1590 1750	CONCLUSIONS In normal-weight healthy young subjects, modest fat gain results in impaired endothelial function, even in the absence of changes in blood pressure.
T2	Participants 1023 1151	RESULTS After an average weight gain of 4.1 kg, fat gainers significantly increased their total, visceral, and subcutaneous fat.
T3	Participants 385 495	METHODS A randomized controlled study was conducted to assess the effects of fat gain on endothelial function.
T4	Participants 76 216	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the impact of fat gain and its distribution on endothelial function in lean healthy humans
