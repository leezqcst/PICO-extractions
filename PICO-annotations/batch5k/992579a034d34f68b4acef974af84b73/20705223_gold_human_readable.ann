OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the impact of fat gain and its distribution on endothelial function in lean healthy humans
Participants 496 586 6
Forty-three normal-weight healthy volunteers were recruited (mean age 29 years; 18 women).
Participants 1590 1750 3
CONCLUSIONS In normal-weight healthy young subjects, modest fat gain results in impaired endothelial function, even in the absence of changes in blood pressure.
