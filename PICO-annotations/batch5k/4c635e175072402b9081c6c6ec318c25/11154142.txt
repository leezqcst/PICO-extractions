Unopposed estrogen increases total plasma factor VII, but not active factor VII--a short-term placebo-controlled study in healthy postmenopausal women.

Estrogen therapy may increase the risk of arterial thromboembolism, at least in the short term. In a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study in 25 healthy postmenopausal women (52.5 +/- 2.8 years), we therefore examined the short-term effect of unopposed estrogen on the fasting and fat-load-stimulated plasma levels of total factor VII versus active factor VII. Plasma total factor VII was measured by use of a chromogenic assay; plasma active FVII by a recently developed method using truncated tissue factor. As compared to placebo, 8 weeks of oral 17beta-estradiol (2 mg daily) increased the mean fasting and postprandial plasma levels of total factor VII by 17 and 21% points, respectively (both P < 0.01 ), but did not affect the fasting and/or postprandial plasma levels of active factor VII (mean change both 0.05 ng/mL; P > 0.35). Furthermore, the change in the fasting level of total factor VII after therapy was not associated with the change in the fasting level of active factor VII (r = 0.27; P = 0.21). These findings argue against the idea that elevated levels of total factor VII underlie an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism in postmenopausal women using unopposed estrogen replacement.
