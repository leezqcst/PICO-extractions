T1	Participants 98 316	effects of insulin, amino acid (AA), and branched-chain ketoacid (KA) availability on leucine kinetics in eight healthy volunteers (age = 22 +/- 2 y, body mass index = 24 +/- 1 kg) by using the euglycemic insulin clamp
T2	Participants 358 399	Four experimental conditions were studied
T3	Participants 744 796	endogenous leucine flux (ELF) averaged 1.20 +/- 0.05
T4	Participants 830 945	basal leucine oxidation (LOX) was 0.25 +/- 0.01; and basal non-oxidative leucine disposal (NOLD) was 0.95 +/- 0.04.
T5	Participants 946 982	ELF significantly decreased in study
T6	Participants 1049 1123	asma AA and branched-chain KA were either maintained at their basal levels
T7	Participants 1351 1372	LOX declined in study
T8	Participants 1671 1693	NOLD declined in study
T9	Participants 2006 2082	A stimulation of NOLD was observed only when plasma AA levels were increased
