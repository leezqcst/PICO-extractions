T1	Participants 10 95	benefits of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass on postoperative systemic metabolism]
T2	Participants 218 310	32 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to either hypothermia
T3	Participants 353 421	hemodynamic parameters and blood samples were obtained after surgery
T4	Participants 670 754	platelet reduction ratio was dependent on the minimum rectal temperature during CPB,
T5	Participants 423 517	CPB and operation times were significantly shorter and the platelet reduction ratio during CPB
T6	Participants 800 965	early postoperative period, hypothermic patients had abnormally high systemic vascular resistance and a reduced cardiac index compared with the normothermic patients
T7	Participants 1145 1203	study suggested a beneficial influence of normothermic CPB
T8	Participants 1248 1327	CPB was not associated with adverse effects on postoperative metabolic recovery
