Incidence of puberty in beef heifers fed high- or low-starch diets for different periods before breeding.

Spring-born Hereford x Angus heifers (n = 206) were used to determine effects of energy supplementation programs and amount of starch in the diet on incidence of puberty. In Exp. 1, heifers (205 +/- 5 kg; n = 68) grazing dormant native pasture were fed 0.9 kg/d (as-fed basis) of a 42% CP supplement from November until February 14. Heifers were stratified by weaning weight and allotted randomly to treatment before breeding (May to July). Treatments were 1) 0.9 kg (as-fed basis) of a 42% CP supplement/d and pasture (control); 2) a high-starch (HS) diet (73% corn; 53% starch) fed in a drylot for 60 d (HS-60); 3) a HS diet fed in drylot for 30 d (HS-30); or 4) a low-starch (LS) diet (49% corn; 37% starch) self-fed on pasture for 30 d (LS-30). The HS-60 and HS-30 heifers were limited-fed to gain 0.9 kg/d, and the LS-30 heifers had ad libitum access to the diet. High-starch-60 and LS-30 heifers were heavier (P < 0.05) than control and HS-30 heifers at the beginning of the breeding season. Thirty-one, 25, and 26% more HS-60 heifers were pubertal (P < 0.05) on May 1 compared with LS-30, HS-30, and control heifers, respectively. At puberty, HS-60 heifers were 24 and 22 d younger (P < 0.05) than LS-30 and control heifers, and 31 kg lighter (P < 0.01) than LS-30 heifers. In Exp. 2, heifers grazed dormant pasture and were fed 0.9 kg (as-fed basis) of a 42% CP supplement/d from weaning in October to late February; then heifers were assigned randomly to treatments for 60 d before the breeding season. In two years, control heifers (n = 46) grazed pasture and received 0.9 kg of SBM supplement/d; LS (n = 46) heifers were self-fed a distiller's grain and soybean hull-based diet in drylot; and HS heifers (n = 46) were limited-fed a corn-based diet in drylot. During treatment, HS and LS heifers had greater weight gains than control heifers. Pubertal BW (313 +/- 6 kg) was not influenced by treatment, but HS and LS heifers were younger (P < 0.03) than control heifers at puberty. During a 60-d breeding period, the incidence of puberty was greater (P < 0.05) for HS and LS heifers than for control heifers and was greater (P < 0.05) in HS than in LS heifers in Year 1. Feeding a LS or a HS diet for 30 d before breeding may be inadequate to stimulate puberty in beef heifers, but feeding a diet with a greater amount of starch for 60 d before breeding may increase the incidence of puberty during breeding of heifers that have inadequate yearling weight.
