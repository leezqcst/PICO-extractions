Participants 105 268 17
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 40 patients to evaluate the need for antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
Participants 269 412 9
All patients were sufficiently ill to require hospitalization although none needed ventilatory support; the presence of pneumonia was excluded.
