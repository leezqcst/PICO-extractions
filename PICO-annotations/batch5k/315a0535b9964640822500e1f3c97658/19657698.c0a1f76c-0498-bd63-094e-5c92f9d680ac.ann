T1	Participants 296 468	Between 1994 and 2004, we retrospectively reviewed 122 patients with rectal cancer whose serum CEA levels were measured on the preoperative day and postoperative days 7 and
T2	Participants 473 535	Patients with preoperative CEA levels <5.0 ng/ml were excluded
T3	Participants 601 979	Patients were categorized into three groups based on R(2) values calculated through trend line, which indicates the correlation coefficient between exponential graph and measured CEA values: exponential decrease group (group 1: 0.9 < R(2) < or = 1.0), nearly exponential decrease group (group 2: 0.5 < R(2) < or = 0.9), and randomized clearance group (group 3: 0.5 < or = R(2)).
