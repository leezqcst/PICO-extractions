postoperative CEA levels in rectal cancer
Participants 296 471 7
Between 1994 and 2004, we retrospectively reviewed 122 patients with rectal cancer whose serum CEA levels were measured on the preoperative day and postoperative days 7 and 30
Participants 473 536 6
Patients with preoperative CEA levels <5.0 ng/ml were excluded.
Participants 601 979 5
Patients were categorized into three groups based on R(2) values calculated through trend line, which indicates the correlation coefficient between exponential graph and measured CEA values: exponential decrease group (group 1: 0.9 < R(2) < or = 1.0), nearly exponential decrease group (group 2: 0.5 < R(2) < or = 0.9), and randomized clearance group (group 3: 0.5 < or = R(2)).
