Poor self-rated health is not associated with a high total allostatic load in type 2 diabetic patients--but high blood pressure is.

OBJECTIVE Allostatic load has been linked to self-rated health (SRH), cardiovascular disease and mortality in non-diabetic individuals. The aim of this study was to construct an allostatic load score and to find any correlations with SRH.
METHODS The subjects included in the study came from a randomized, controlled trial of type 2 diabetes. Blood samples were drawn, urine was collected for 24h, and questionnaires, including SRH, were filled out on three occasions: at baseline; after the 10-week intervention; and at a follow-up 3 months after the intervention. Allostatic load was estimated using a wide range of variables, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, cortisol, catecholamines, HbA(1c), insulin, plasma glucose and waist circumference.
RESULTS There was no association between SRH and allostatic load. However, three other components were significantly correlated with allostatic load at the baseline investigation and the two follow-up investigations - namely, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and HbA(1c).
CONCLUSION The absence of an association between allostatic load and SRH in diabetic individuals contrasts with previous findings in non-diabetic women, and shows that it is hazardous to apply findings in one population to another, especially diabetic and non-diabetic populations.
