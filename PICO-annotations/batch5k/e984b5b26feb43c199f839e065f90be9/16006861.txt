Prospective, randomized comparison of transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

PURPOSE We report a prospective, randomized comparison of transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (TLA) vs retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (RLA) for adrenal lesions with long-term followup.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Between December 1997 and November 1999, 57 consecutive eligible patients with surgical adrenal disease were prospectively randomized to undergo TLA (25) or RLA (32). Study exclusion criteria were patient age greater than 80 years, body mass index greater than 40, bilateral adrenalectomy and significant prior abdominal surgery in the quadrant of interest. Mean followup was 5.96 years in the 2 groups.
RESULTS The groups were matched in regard to patient age (p = 0.84), body mass index (p = 0.43), American Society of Anesthesiologists class (p = 0.81) and laterality (p = 0.12). Median adrenal mass size was 2.7 cm (range 1 to 9) in the TLA group and 2.6 cm (range 0.5 to 6) in the RLA group (p = 0.83). TLA was comparable to RLA in terms of operative time (130 vs 126.5 minutes, p = 0.64), estimated blood loss (p = 0.92), specimen weight (p = 0.81), analgesic requirements (p = 0.25), hospital stay (p = 0.56) and the complication rate (p = 0.58). One case per group was electively converted to open surgery. Pathology data on the intact extracted specimens were similar between the groups. Averaged convalescence was 4.7 weeks in the TLA group and 2.3 weeks in the RLA group (p = 0.02). During a mean followup of 6 years 2 patients in the TLA group had a late complication (port site hernia). Mortality occurred in 5 patients, including 1 with TLA and 4 with RLA, during the 6-year followup.
CONCLUSIONS For most benign adrenal lesions requiring surgery laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be performed safely and effectively by the transperitoneal or the retroperitoneal approach.
