Doxymycine-cyanoacrylate treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcers.

OBJECTIVE This study addressed the efficacy of singularly applied topical doxymycine in the pain relief treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
STUDY DESIGN Thirty-one patients with recurrent aphthous lesions were examined and divided randomly in two groups. Experimental group (n = 15) received a topical application of doxymycine and controls (n = 16) received calcii gluconase in the same manner. Medications were covered by isobutyl cyanoacrylate (Iso-Dent). Application was made only once during the recurrent aphthous ulcer episode.
RESULTS Patients recorded their pain level on a visual analog scale for 10 days during healing. Pain decreased more rapidly in the experimental group, and a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the pain intensity was found from the second to the seventh day after application of doxymycine.
CONCLUSIONS In recurrent aphthous ulcers, singular treatment of topical doxymycine-cyanoacrylate relieves the pain intensity remarkably for 6 days after a 1 day latency period. Topical doxymycine treatment further exerts potential to directly prevent tissue destruction and to indirectly suppress host inflammatory reaction.
