A controlled trial of cisapride in anorexia nervosa.

To determine the efficacy of cisapride, 10 mg three times daily, in improving gastric emptying, reducing distress during meals, and facilitating weight gain in anorexia nervosa, we conducted an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 29 inpatients. Measures included scintigraphic gastric emptying studies at 0, 2, 4, and 8 weeks; subjective distress during meals measured by visual analogue scales; self-rating of degree of global improvement in symptoms associated with eating at end of study; and weight measured weekly. Gastric emptying improved significantly but equally in both groups over the study period. Yet subjective measures were better in the cisapride group; they rated themselves as more hungry (p = .02) and more improved on the global measure of change in symptoms (p = .02). Even so, the cisapride group did not gain more weight. The correlation between gastric emptying and weight gain was modest (r = .30; p = .11), and between gastric emptying and the subjective measures, virtually absent.
