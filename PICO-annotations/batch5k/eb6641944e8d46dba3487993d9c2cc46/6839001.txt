Human platelet response to three salicylate dosage forms.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) inhibition of platelet aggregation as evaluated by collagen-induced 14C-serotonin release, has been measured in 12 healthy male subjects. Each subject received a single oral dose (650 mg) of enteric-coated ASA (ecASA) and compressed ASA tablets (cASA), or ecASA and sodium salicylate (578 mg) separated by a minimum of 5 weeks. The platelet response was related to plasma ASA and salicyclic acid determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Both ecASA and cASA inhibited 14C-serotonin release; no significant difference was observed in the maximum effect between these two products (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between the maximum observed plasma ASA level and the maximum effect. Further, no correlation was found between the maximum inhibition of 14C-serotonin release in vivo and the release predicted from in vitro experiments wherein the effect was measured after incubating plasma containing specified ASA concentrations.
