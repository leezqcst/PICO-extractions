A study of a Self-Care Rehabilitation Program in pediatric asthma.

The Self-Care Rehabilitation in Pediatric Asthma (SCRPA) project was designed to ascertain the level to which children with asthma are able to acquire the asthma knowledge and skills presented in a self-management training program conducted by the American Lung Association of Utah and the effect of such training on the asthma experience. The preschool SCRPA Curriculum (ages 2-5) consisted of six 1-hour classes scheduled twice a week for 3 weeks. The first and last classes were for one or both parents only, and the middle four sessions were for the child and parent(s). The school-age SCRPA curriculum (ages 6-14) consisted of eight 90-minute classes for both child and parent(s) scheduled twice a week for 4 weeks. Private physicians referred 21 preschool children and 38 school-age children into the program. The school-age children were randomly assigned to a study or control group, and the preschool children served as their own controls. A comparison of asthma episodes during the 3 months before and after training showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of episodes but no change in severity in the preschool, school study, and school control groups. The decrease in episodes for the control groups suggest that the family record keeping required of all subjects may have a beneficial effect, a phenomenon worth further investigation. Also, the school-age group, in pre- and posttesting, demonstrated that the SCRPA curriculum increased knowledge and skills in the study group, changes not found in the control group.
