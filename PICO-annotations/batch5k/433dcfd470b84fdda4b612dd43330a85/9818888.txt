Long-term outcome of migraine therapy: predictive value of the frontotemporal nitroglycerin test.

We evaluated whether type of response to the migraine-induction test with a nitroglycerin ointment applied to the frontotemporal head region could predict the efficacy of antimigraine therapy. Forty-two patients with migraine without aura underwent the test before and 2 months after antimigraine therapy. Two and 4 months after treatment withdrawal, most subjects with a negative response to the post-treatment test maintained treatment benefit, whereas benefit was lost in patients with an early onset migraine response.
