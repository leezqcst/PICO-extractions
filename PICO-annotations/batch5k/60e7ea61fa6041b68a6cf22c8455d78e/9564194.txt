The problem of measurement error in multisite clinical trials.

The implementation of a multisite, randomized, clinical psychopharmacologic trial involves a substantial investment of time and effort on the part of all participants. Because of their complexity, such clinical trials present unique methodological and design challenges. Indeed, it is not uncommon for such studies to conclude with uninterpretable results, due in part to such methodological pitfalls. It has been suggested that clarification of such methodologic dilemmas is one of the most important challenges facing the future of industry-sponsored psychopharmacologic drug development. Among the many factors that may contribute to problematic clinical trial results, error in measuring the phenomena being studied is of particular concern. In this article, we describe the outcome of an intensive series of interrater reliability training sessions for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale conducted at the start of a Phase II multisite clinical drug trial. The data underscore the magnitude of error present in such a test setting and provide preliminary evidence for the potential effect of this problem on the detection of clinical change.
