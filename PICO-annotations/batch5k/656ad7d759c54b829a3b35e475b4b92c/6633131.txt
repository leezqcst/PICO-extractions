Carbon dioxide laser treatment of vaginal adenosis in DES-exposed offspring: a prospective study.

Seventy-nine patients with history and physical findings characteristic of antenatal DES exposure were randomly divided into two groups. Fourty-four DES-exposed offspring had their vaginal adenosis treated with the carbon dioxide laser (group I), and the remaining 35 DES-exposed offspring (group II) did not receive any specific treatment for this condition. Additionally, the 79 DES-exposed offspring were compared to an age-matched control population (group III). Treatment of vaginal adenosis with the carbon dioxide laser did not significantly reduce the incidence of development of new dysplasia in the DES-exposed offspring. This study also showed no statistical difference (p less than or equal to 0.05) in the incidence of dysplasia in DES-exposed offspring as compared to a control population.
