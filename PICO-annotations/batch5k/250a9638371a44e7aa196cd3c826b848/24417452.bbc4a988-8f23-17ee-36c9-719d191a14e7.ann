T1	Participants 1212 1504	CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary evidence that time-processing ability and managing one's time can be improved by intervention using time aids in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities, supporting the need to consider time aids in intervention in these children.
T2	Participants 697 932	RESULTS Children in both groups gained significantly in time-processing ability between the first and second data collection, but the children in the intervention group improved time-processing ability significantly more than controls.
T3	Participants 269 447	METHODS Participating children (n = 47) (F17/M30) were aged 6-11 with ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, mild or moderate intellectual disability, spina bifida, and cerebral palsy.
T4	Participants 72 268	OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate complex intervention using time aids for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities who exhibit limitations in daily time management.
