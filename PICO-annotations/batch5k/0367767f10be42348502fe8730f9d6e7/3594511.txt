Effects of pindolol and clopamide on blood lipids in arterial hypertensive patients.

The effects of clopamide, pindolol and its combination on plasma lipids in 49 hypertensive patients (WHO I-II), divided into three parallel randomized groups, were studied over a 6 months period. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol fractions were determined twice during an initial 4-week washout phase, and after a 1-, 3- and 6-month active hypotensive drug phase. Patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits. Daily drug doses were adjusted progressively to attain optimal hypotensive effects. In the clopamide monotherapy group, total cholesterol increased significantly (p less than 0.05); triglycerides and LDL showed a tendency to increase while for HDL a tendency to decrease was observed. In the pindolol monotherapy group, a significant reduction of triglycerides (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase of HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.05) were recorded. No significant changes in total cholesterol or LDL fraction were observed. Combined pindolol-clopamide therapy decreased total triglycerides (NS), increased HDL significantly (p less than 0.05) and did not influence total cholesterol and LDL fraction. It is concluded that pindolol does not negatively influence blood lipids as the thiazide-type diuretic clopamide does, and that when both drugs are used together, the beta-blocker can probably counterbalance the diuretic-induced negative effects on blood lipids. Accordingly, it is suggested that pindolol could be a more favorable beta-blocker drug to be used on hypertensive subjects with metabolic coronary risk factors.
