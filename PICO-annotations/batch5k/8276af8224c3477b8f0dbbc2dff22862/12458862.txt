Prospective randomized trial of an anterior surface modified prolate intraocular lens.

PURPOSE We compare the contrast sensitivity obtained with an anterior surface modified prolate intraocular lens with the contrast sensitivity obtained with a standard spherical intraocular lens.
METHODS Patients presenting for cataract surgery in one eye were randomized to receive either the Tecnis Z9000 intraocular lens (Pharmacia) or the AMO AR40e Opti-Edge intraocular lens (AMO). Sine wave grating contrast sensitivity testing under mesopic and photopic conditions served as the principal outcome measure.
RESULTS The Tecnis Z9000 intraocular lens provided statistically significantly better contrast sensitivity at 1.5 and 3 cycles per degree under mesopic conditions and at 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree under photopic conditions.
CONCLUSION The use of a modified prolate intraocular lens during cataract surgery has the potential to improve contrast sensitivity under both mesopic and photopic conditions.
