The effect of trandolapril and its fixed-dose combination with verapamil on circulating adhesion molecules levels in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.

BACKGROUND AND AIM Endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive type-2 diabetic patients is associated with increased levels of circulating soluble adhesion molecules (SAM). SAM participate in the development of diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of trandolapril (T) and its fixed-dose combination with verapamil (FDTV) on SAM levels in hypertensive type-2 diabetic patients.
METHODS Forty type-2 diabetic patients with never-treated hypertension were randomly assigned to two groups. One group (FDTV) received 2/180 mg once a day; the other group received T 2 mg once a day. Study drugs were administered for three months in both groups. VCAM-1, ICAM, and E-selectin were measured by ELISA at the beginning and end of the study. Patients were evaluated monthly for blood pressure, fasting serum glucose, and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA.
RESULTS Both therapeutics regimens reduced significantly the levels of the SAM tested. When both groups were compared, we did not find a significant difference in ICAM and E-selectin reduction. However, VCAM-1 presented a significantly greater reduction (p = 0.022) in the trandolapril-verapamil group. No patient suffered adverse events.
CONCLUSION Our results show that FDTV produces a greater reduction of VCAM-1 circulating levels than trandolapril alone. This may explain some of the beneficial effects of this fixed dosed combination that are non-related to its antihypertensive effects.
