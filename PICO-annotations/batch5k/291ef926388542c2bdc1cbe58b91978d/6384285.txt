Double-blind efficacy study of selenium sulfide in tinea versicolor.

Selenium sulfide (2.5%) lotion applied daily for 10 minutes for 7 consecutive days was found to be an effective therapeutic agent, significantly superior to the vehicle, in a double-blind study in the treatment of tinea versicolor. Mild transitory contact dermatitis of the primary irritant type occurred in all the treatment groups and was apparently due to the detergent base.
