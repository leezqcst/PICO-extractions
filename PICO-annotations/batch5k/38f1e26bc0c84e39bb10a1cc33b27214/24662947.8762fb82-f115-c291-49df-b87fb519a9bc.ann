T1	Participants 23 140	phase 2 clinical trial of a recombinant human endostatin adenovirus in patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma
T2	Participants 143 443	A randomized, open-label, phase 2, multicenter clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of a recombinant human endostatin adenovirus (E10A) to cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
T3	Participants 444 728	Patients with locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma not suitable for operation or radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive E10A plus chemotherapy every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles or to receive chemotherapy only
T4	Participants 730 798	One hundred and thirty-six eligible patients were randomly assigned.
T5	Participants 919 1046	patients who received endostatin had longer progression-free survival (7.03 versus 3.60 months, P = 0.006; hazard ratio: 0.55).
T6	Participants 1051 1275	combination of E10A with chemotherapy benefited prior chemotherapy-treated patients and those who received three to four treatment cycles (6.50 versus 3.43 months, P = 0.003; 8.27 versus 4.27 months, P = 0.018; respectively)
T7	Participants 1495 1654	E10A plus chemotherapy is a safe and effective therapeutic approach in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma
