T1	Participants 64 147	relieving neuroendocrino-immunological effect inhibited by exogenous glucocorticoid
T2	Participants 161 309	To study protective effect of Epimedium brevicornum (EB) on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-thymus (HPAT) axis inhibited by exogenous glucocorticoid.
T3	Participants 340 606	variation of cortisol, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), lymphocyte proliferative reaction were observed before and after medication in 65 patients took prednisone, and were randomly divided into Fufang prednisone group (mixture of prednisone and EB) and prednisone group
T4	Participants 624 754	model of HPAT axis inhibited by corticosterone (CORT) was established to observe the effect of EB on relevant indices of HPAT axis
