Prospective, randomized trial of diclofenac and ketorolac after refractive surgery.

PURPOSE To compare the effectiveness of diclofenac and ketorolac in relieving corneal pain after refractive surgery, and determine if there is a difference in stinging on instillation.
METHODS Thirty patients were randomized prospectively to postoperative diclofenac in one eye and ketorolac in the other. Patients and surgeon did not know which medications were used. Ocular postoperative pain and discomfort on instillation of medication were measured after radial keratotomy with a visual analog scale and a questionnaire.
RESULTS Both medications were highly effective in relieving pain. There was no significant difference in pain relief, or stinging on instillation (P = .29).
CONCLUSION There was no statistical difference in the effectiveness of the medications on pain relief, or in stinging on instillation.
