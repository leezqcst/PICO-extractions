Using the virtual reality-cognitive rehabilitation approach to improve contextual processing in children with autism.

BACKGROUND This pilot study investigated the efficacy of a novel virtual reality-cognitive rehabilitation (VR-CR) intervention to improve contextual processing of objects in children with autism. Previous research supports that children with autism show deficits in contextual processing, as well as deficits in its elementary components: abstraction and cognitive flexibility.
METHODS Four children with autism participated in a multiple-baseline, single-subject study. The children were taught how to see objects in context by reinforcing attention to pivotal contextual information.
RESULTS All children demonstrated statistically significant improvements in contextual processing and cognitive flexibility. Mixed results were found on the control test and changes in context-related behaviours.
CONCLUSIONS Larger-scale studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness and usability in comprehensive educational programs.
