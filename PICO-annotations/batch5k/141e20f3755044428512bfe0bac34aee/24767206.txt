[The effects of tirofiban on acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients not receiving early reperfusion intervention].

OBJECTIVE To study the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute non-ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) without early reperfusion intervention.
METHODS A total of 151 NSTEMI patients without early reperfusion intervention were enrolled in the study and randomized to the tirofiban group (n = 76) and the control group(n = 75). Coronary angiography was performed at day 3 and day 7, while percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed when necessary. Parameters including thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, bleeding complications and clinic events within 30 days were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS Before PCI, no increase in the percentage of patient with TIMI flow better than TIMI-2 was observed by the treatment of tirofiban (69.3% vs 78.9%, P = 0.10). While after PCI, significant increase in the percentage of patient with TIMI flow better than TIMI-2 was manifested in the tirofiban group (96.0% vs 100.0%, P = 0.04). Tirofiban treatment also significantly decreased the rate of poor myocardial perfusion after PCI (19.7% vs 34.7%, P = 0.04). There were 0 and 4 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 30 days observed in the tirofiban group and the control group (0.0% vs 5.3%, P = 0.05). No difference between the two groups was found in the bleeding complications within 30 days including the mild hemorrhage (5 vs 4 cases, P = 0.75), severe hemorrhage (2 vs 1 cases, P = 0.56) or severe thrombocytopenia (2 vs 0 cases, P = 0.49).
CONCLUSIONS Tirofiban treatment does not increase the bleeding complications in NSTEMI patients without early PCI. Tirofiban can improve the TIMI flow and the myocardial perfusion after PCI with less MACE within 30 days.
