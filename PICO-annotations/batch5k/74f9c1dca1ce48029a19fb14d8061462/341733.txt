The effect of metronidazole on the incidence of postoperative wound infection in elective colon surgery.

A prospective randomized clinical trial assessing the relative effectiveness of erythromycin-neomycin and metronidazole-neomycin as a preoperative bowel preparation was carried out. Bacteriologic studies of feces and colon content revealed no significant difference in the reduction of aerobic bacteria between the two groups. There was, however, a significantly greater reduction in anaerobic bacteria in the feces and colon contents of patients receiving metronidazole. Wound infection rate was 25% in the erythromycin group, and organisms recovered from the wound in all cases were fecal in nature. Two wound infections occurred in the metronidazole group (5%) and in both cases the organisms recovered were staphylococci of presumed skin origin. These studies suggest that anaerobic bacteria are the major contributors to wound infection after colon surgery and that their specific reduction is associated with a lower incidence of wound infection.
