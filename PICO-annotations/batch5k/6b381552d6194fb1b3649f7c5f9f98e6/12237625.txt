Hysteroscopic transcervical endometrial resection versus thermal destruction for menorrhagia: a prospective randomized trial on satisfaction rate.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the satisfaction rate and the effectiveness of transcervical hysteroscopic endometrial resection and thermal destruction of the endometrium in the treatment of menorrhagia.
STUDY DESIGN A prospective randomized trial with 2 years of follow-up was carried out in the Department of Gynecology of the University of Naples. Eighty-two patients who were affected by menorrhagia that was unresponsive to medical treatment were respectively randomized to transcervical hysteroscopic endometrial resection or to thermal destruction of the endometrium. Satisfaction rate, operative time, discharge time, complication rate, reintervention rate, and resumption of normal activity were evaluated in each group.
RESULTS The satisfaction rate was significantly higher in the thermal destruction group. Operative time was significantly shorter in the thermal destruction group (24 +/- 4 minutes vs 37 +/- 6 minutes). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the thermal destruction group (7.2 +/- 2.8 mL vs 89 +/- 38 mL). Reintervention rates were higher in the transcervical hysteroscopic endometrial resection group, although postoperative pain was not significantly different between the two groups. Discharge time, complication rate, and resumption of normal activity were not significantly different between the two groups.
CONCLUSION Thermal destruction of the endometrium for the treatment of menorrhagia should be considered an effective therapeutic option because of its acceptability among patients, shorter operative time, and lower blood loss.
