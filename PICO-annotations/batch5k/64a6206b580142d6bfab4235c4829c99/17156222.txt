Midazolam vs ondansetron for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting: a randomised controlled trial.

We compared the prophylactic anti-emetic efficacy of midazolam and ondansetron in 90 patients scheduled for minor gynaecological (hysteroscopy) or urological (ureteroscopy) procedures planned to last 1-2 h under sevoflurane anaesthesia with spontaneous ventilation of the lungs via a laryngeal mask airway. Midazolam 2 mg or ondansetron 4 mg were administered intravenously 30 min before the end of surgery. The proportions of patients who experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting in the first 24 h (30% and 27% for the midazolam and ondansetron groups, respectively) were similar in the two groups. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly smaller in both groups than predicted according to the patients' underlying risks (midazolam group: p = 0.018; ondansetron group: p = 0.017). There were no significant differences in average sedation scores or pain scores. Treatment using ondansetron for anti-emetic prophylaxis did not provide a superior benefit compared to midazolam in the present study.
