Simvastatin and preparation of polyunsaturated phospholipids produce similar changes in the phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins during hypercholesterolemia.

We studied the phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins in patients with coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia treated with simvastatin (Zocor, inhibitor of the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis) and preparation of polyunsaturated phospholipids (lipostabil forte). Simvastatin produced a hypolipidemic effect and modulates the phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins (similarly to lipostabil forte). These changes contribute to functional activity of high-density lipoproteins in the reverse cholesterol transport.
