T1	Participants 50 115	transthoracic echocardiographic detection of patent foramen ovale
T2	Participants 697 737	a randomly selected group of 70 patients
T3	Participants 1077 1153	experienced echocardiographer unaware of the sequence and site of injections
T4	Participants 1208 1297	+1 (minimal left ventricular opacification) to +4 (intense left ventricular opacification
T5	Participants 1445 1530	significantly more often during femoral vein versus upper extremity contrast delivery
T6	Participants 1618 1722	The intensity of left ventricular opacification was also greater during femoral vein contrast injection.
T7	Participants 1986 2094	significantly enhances the ability of precordial contrast echocardiography to diagnose patent foramen ovale.
