Effect of ginseng extract supplementation on testicular functions in diabetic rats.

OBJECTIVE It was aimed to investigate the effect of standardized ginseng extract on fertility parameters in diabetic rats.
METHODS Thirty male rats were randomly allocated into three groups of 10 rats each: 1. controls, 2. diabetes (D) and 3. diabetes + ginseng (DG). The latter two groups were rendered diabetic by i.p. injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg). Standardized ginseng extract (Dansk Droge A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) was administered per os (100 mg/kg BW) by stomach tube daily for 90 days starting one week after STZ. Ninety days post STZ the rats were sacrificed, and testis, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles were weighed and subjected to histological examination. In addition, spermiogram, testicular enzyme markers, intratesticular steroid hormonal profile and testicular antioxidant status were estimated.
RESULTS The administration of ginseng extract resulted in a significant improvement of fertility parameters and testicular antioxidants together with a decrease in malondialdehyde and testicular pathological signs including degenerative changes of the seminiferous tubules.
CONCLUSION Ginseng extract may be a beneficial adjuvant therapy for diabetics suffering from infertility as a complication.
