The quality of anaesthesia provided by three dosages of prilocaine, 40 ml 0.5%, 20 ml 1%, or 40 ml 1%, administered in random order, for intravenous regional anaesthesia of the lower extremity below the knee was compared in six volunteers. Limited sensory blockade was achieved in the groups with 40 ml 0.5% and 20 ml 1% during the 30-minute test period. One subject was not fully anaesthetised with any of the dosages used.
