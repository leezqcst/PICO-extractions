[Effects of Kang Gang Qian Granule (KGQG) on clinical and pathological features in chronic hepatitis B patients].

OBJECTIVE To explore the efficacy of KGQG and its therapeutic mechanisms in chronic hepatitis B patients with liver fibrosis.
METHODS 57 chronic hepatitis B patients with liver fibrosis were randomly divided into two groups: 45 cases in KGQG group were treated by KGQG and routine medications; 12 cases in control group were treated by routine medications only. Serum liver function test results, PCIII, CIV, HA and liver biopsy results of these 57 patients were simultaneously collected and analyzed before and after this intervention.
RESULTS KGQG group showed better efficacy over control group in liver function recovery, decrease of serum PCIII, CIV, HA levels and liver pathologic grades (P 0.05 or 0.01).
CONCLUSION The KGQG could effectively ameliorate liver function and facilitate the inhibition and degradation of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B patients, which may be developed as a novel therapeusis to treat this hard-to-cure disease.
