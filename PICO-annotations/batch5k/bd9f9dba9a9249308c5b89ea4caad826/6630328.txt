A controlled trial of 'Senokot' in faecal soiling treated by behavioural methods.

A double-blind randomly controlled trial of one particular laxative, Senokot, used in moderate dosage, was carried out on a group of 40 children with severe and persistent soiling and often with a history of faecal retention. Significant improvement occurred following three months of outpatient treatment using a behavioural approach and either Senokot, placebo or no medication. However, there was no evidence either during the trial or subsequently when Senokot was employed to supplement behavioural treatment in every child who continued with therapy that this laxative contributed in any way to relieving the problem in this group of cases.
