T1	Participants 22 111	"stage-of-change" oriented smoking cessation intervention in infertile and pregnant women
T2	Participants 124 259	To assess a "stage-of-change" oriented smoking cessation intervention for infertile and pregnant women, compared with standard of care.
T3	Participants 381 468	Infertile women at their first visit to a tertiary referral infertility clinic (n = 94)
T4	Participants 473 573	new patients seeking pre-natal care (n = 110) who had smoked >/= 3 cigarettes in the past six months
T5	Participants 648 714	specific to the woman's "stage-of-change" in the smoking continuum
T6	Participants 947 1145	Intervention and control were similarly effective for infertile women: the rate of maintained cessation rose significantly from 4% to 24% over twelve months, with a mean delta "stage-of-change" 0.28
T7	Participants 1150 1196	prenatal women, neither approach was effective
T8	Participants 1198 1280	Maintained cessation did not significantly change from 0 to 12 months (19% to 18%)
T9	Participants 1282 1328	Mean delta "stage-of-change" declined by -0.62
T10	Participants 1344 1523	For infertile women, basic information describing the impact of smoking on fertility, along with exhaled CO monitoring and a more intensive intervention were both highly effective
T11	Participants 1525 1617	In pregnant women neither approach was beneficial, with some evidence of post-partum relapse
