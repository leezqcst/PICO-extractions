T1	Participants 255 323	used to evaluate the dynamic balance related to falls in the elderly
T2	Participants 703 789	Fifty-seven elderly females who live independently (age 74.8Â±5.6 years) were recruited
T3	Participants 864 976	Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of both tests were high (for MSL: ICC=0.95, for MDSL: ICC=0.81-0.82)
T4	Participants 978 1104	Age and ADL significantly correlated to MDSL (age: r=-0.32-0.41, ADL: r=0.28-0.48), but not to MSL (age: r=-0.19, ADL: r=0.15)
T5	Participants 1106 1160	MDSL has high reliability as it relates to age and ADL
T6	Participants 1162 1280	It may be more useful to evaluate ADL required for independent living and prevent falls in the elderly better than MSL
