Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after stentless versus conventional aortic valve replacement.

The goal of this study was to analyze regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after randomization to conventional biological versus stentless aortic valve replacement. Stentless (Freestyle, Toronto, n = 106) or conventional biological aortic valves (Carpentier-Edwards, n = 74) were evaluated prospectively. Preoperatively there were no differences with regard to aortic valve pathology, left ventricular function, and pressure gradients between the two patient groups. The patient annulus index (13.55 vs. 13.46 mm; NS) measured intraoperatively was used as baseline for further comparison. Postoperatively, left ventricular mass index was 213+/-77 g/m2 (stentless) compared with 202+/-72 (conventional group) g/m2 (NS), whereas after 6 months it was 141+/-41 g/m2 in the stentless and 170+/-43 g/m2 in the conventional group (P<.05). Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy occurs in all patients after aortic valve replacement. Nevertheless, the use of stentless bioprostheses leads to a significant enhancement, which may result in a reduction of the cardiac risk profile for the patient.
