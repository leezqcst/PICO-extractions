T1	Participants 13 88	multicenter, 8-week, parallel-group, randomized,double-blind, double-dummy,
T2	Participants 208 258	Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension
T3	Participants 372 378	Korea.
T4	Participants 612 662	Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension
T5	Participants 683 784	multicenter, 8-week, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, Phase III clinical trial
T6	Participants 786 979	Eligible patients were Korean, aged 18 to 75 years, had hypertension, and were either taking antihypertensive medications or had a documented sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 109 mm Hg
T7	Participants 1016 1097	patients were randomized to amlodipine maleate or amlodipine besylate for 8 weeks
T8	Participants 1102 1156	both groups, the medications were initiated at 5 mg QD
T9	Participants 1226 1278	diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was > or = 90 mm Hg
T10	Participants 1288 1331	One hundred eighteen patients were enrolled
T11	Participants 1333 1522	Fifty-seven patients received amlodipine maleate (29 men, 28 women; mean [SD] age, 49.0 [11.4] years) and 61 received amlodipine besylate (35 men, 26 women; mean [SD] age, 51.6 [9.4] years)
T12	Participants 1524 1781	Baseline mean (SD) values for sitting systolic blood pressure and SiDBP were 152.0 (12.2) mm Hg and 98.1 (5.6) mm Hg, respectively, for the amlodipine maleate group and 153.4 (14.0) mm Hg and 98.1 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively, for the amlodipine besylate group
T13	Participants 1783 1801	In this population
T14	Participants 1966 2227	The between-group difference in SiDBP response rate (the proportion of patients who experienced adequate SiDBP reductions) did not reach statistical significance: 85.7% (42/49) for the amlodipine maleate group and 91.8% (45/49) for the amlodipine besylate group
T15	Participants 2229 2410	Compliance rates were similar between groups, with mean (SD) compliance rates of 97.4% (2.8%) and 97.1% (3.6%) in the amlodipine maleate and amlodipine besylate groups, respectively
T16	Participants 2613 2631	In this population
