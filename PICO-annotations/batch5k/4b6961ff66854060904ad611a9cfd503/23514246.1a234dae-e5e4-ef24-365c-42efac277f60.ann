T1	Participants 1104 1380	METHODS/DESIGN The target patient population comprises OPSCC patients who would be unlikely to require chemotherapy post-resection: Tumor stage T1-T2 with likely negative margins at surgery; Nodal stage N0-2, â‰¤3 cm in size, with no evidence of extranodal extension on imaging.
T2	Participants 158 357	BACKGROUND The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has markedly increased over the last three decades due to newly found associations with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
T3	Participants 2229 2390	The trial is designed to provide a definitive QOL comparison between the two arms, and to inform the design of an eventual phase III trial for survival outcomes.
