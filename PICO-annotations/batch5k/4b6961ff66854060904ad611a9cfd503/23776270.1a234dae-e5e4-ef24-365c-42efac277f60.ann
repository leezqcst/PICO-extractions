T1	Participants 0 96	Long-term effects of choline on productive performance and egg quality of brown-egg laying hens.
T2	Participants 1349 1472	The effect of choline on egg quality was minimal when hens were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet from 19 to 68 wk of age.
T3	Participants 98 352	A total of five hundred forty 19-wk-old HyLine Brown hens were used to study the long-term effects of increasing choline with 0 (control), 425, 850, 1,700, 3,400, and 6,800 mg/kg of corn-soybean meal-based diets on productive performance and egg quality.
T4	Participants 1231 1348	This study indicates that a dietary choline level of no more than 700 mg/kg is sufficient to maintain egg production.
