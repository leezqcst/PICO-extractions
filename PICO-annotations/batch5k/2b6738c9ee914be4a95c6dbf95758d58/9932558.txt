Videotaped training in alcohol counseling for obstetric care practitioners: a randomized controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility of videotaped training for obstetric care practitioners in motivational interviewing skills that could be used in brief patient consultations on problem drinking.
METHODS Thirty health care practitioners participated in a clinical trial using a 20-minute videotape to instruct them in motivational interviewing. Participants engaged in a pretest roleplay with an actress playing a drinking pregnant woman. Those randomly assigned to the experimental condition watched the motivational interviewing videotape. Control condition participants watched a 20-minute docudrama of a pregnant problem drinker. Both groups then engaged in a post-test roleplay similar to the pretest. Behavioral ratings of the roleplays and participant evaluations of the motivational interviewing video constituted the outcome measures.
RESULTS Participant evaluations indicated that the training video was clear in explaining and demonstrating the principles and skills of motivational interviewing. Change in behavioral ratings from pretest to post-test showed significant differences in motivational interviewing skills between the experimental and control groups. Obstetric care practitioners who viewed the training video were rated as showing greater empathy, minimizing patient defensiveness, and supporting women's beliefs in their ability to change.
CONCLUSION Obstetric care practitioners can improve their alcohol intervention skills through the use of a 20-minute videotaped instruction in motivational interviewing. Clinicians who improve their skills in motivational interviewing can intervene more effectively with their drinking pregnant patients. Using motivational interviewing with this population holds promise for helping prevent alcohol-related health problems.
