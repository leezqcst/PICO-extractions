[Accelerated postoperative radiotherapy in patients with advanced larynx cancer].

AIM The aim of study was test efficacy of accelerated postoperative radiotherapy--concomitant boost in patients with advanced larynx cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS The prospective study included 112 patients with advanced larynx cancer after radical surgical treatment. Patients had postoperative radiation therapy, conventional (C) or accelerated (CB).
RESULTS The 3-year overall survival in CB was 59%, in C--58% (p = 0.2), 3-year locoregional control in CB--83%, in C--75% (p = 0.01), the 3-year disease free survival was in CB--72%, C--66% (p = 0.1).
CONCLUSION Concomitant boost postoperative radiation therapy did not improve overall survival, loco-regional control, disease free survival. Patients with close surgical margins, longer interval between surgery and radiation, high level of hemoglobin, T4 had benefit from accelerated radiotherapy.
