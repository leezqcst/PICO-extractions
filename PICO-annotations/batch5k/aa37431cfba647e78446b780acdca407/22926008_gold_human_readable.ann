We conducted a randomized controlled trial among African-American patients attending a primary-care provider visit to compare efficacy of a computer-delivered tailored intervention to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening (n = 273) with non-tailored print material-an American Cancer Society brochure on CRC screening (n = 283).
