T1	Participants 954 1173	Findings show that computer-delivered tailored interventions are an effective adjunct to the clinical encounter that can improve knowledge and health beliefs about CRC screening, necessary precursors to behavior change.
T2	Participants 125 458	We conducted a randomized controlled trial among African-American patients attending a primary-care provider visit to compare efficacy of a computer-delivered tailored intervention to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening (n = 273) with non-tailored print material-an American Cancer Society brochure on CRC screening (n = 283).
T3	Participants 555 702	Analysis of covariance models were used to compare changes between CRC knowledge and health belief scores at baseline and 1 week post-intervention.
