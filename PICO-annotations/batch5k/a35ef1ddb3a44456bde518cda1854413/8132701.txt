Treatment with coumarin to prevent or delay recurrence of malignant melanoma.

Both coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone) and warfarin (4-hydroxycoumarin) have been shown to prevent the recurrence of malignant melanoma. Their action is macrophage-dependent and the dosage is critical. In 1984 a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind trial of coumarin, given as a daily 50-mg dose for 2 years after surgery in patients with high-risk melanoma, was started. the patients had lesions greater than 1.70 mm thick and TNM stage IB or stage II disease. To date there are 4 recurrences in the coumarin-treated group of 13 patients, and 10 recurrences in the placebo-treated group of 14 patients (P < 0.01). There were no toxic effects.
