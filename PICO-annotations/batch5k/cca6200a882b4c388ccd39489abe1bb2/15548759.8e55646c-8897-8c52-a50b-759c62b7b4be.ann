T1	Participants 116 425	We have investigated the effect of modest supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (100 mg/day), beta-carotene (6 mg/day), vitamin C (100 mg/day) and selenium (50 microg/day) on oxidative stress and chromosomal damage, and the influence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype on these end-points
T2	Participants 427 470	Subjects were two groups of middle-aged men
T3	Participants 505 581	46 survivors of myocardial infarction before age 50 and 60 healthy controls.
T4	Participants 592 674	randomly divided into equal groups to receive antioxidants or placebo for 12 weeks
T5	Participants 676 739	Twenty-eight patients and 58 controls completed the interventio
T6	Participants 1275 1449	Homocysteine levels in subjects with the TT variant genotype were significantly higher compared with CT or CC (P = 0.001), especially in subjects with low folate (P = 0.012).
T7	Participants 1450 1529	In the placebo control group an increase in micronuclei (P = 0.04) was detected
T8	Participants 1569 1620	This effect was not seen in the supplemented group.
T9	Participants 1621 1799	In antioxidant-supplemented myocardial infarction survivors we found an increase in the ferric reducing ability of plasma (P < 0.001) and a decrease in malondialdehyde (P = 0.001
T10	Participants 1802 1902	Micronucleus frequency showed a decrease, strongest in subjects with normal folate levels (P = 0.015
T11	Participants 1908 2113	subjects with low folate levels, a high correlation was found between micronuclei after supplementation and homocysteine, both before (r = 0.979, P = 0.002) and after supplementation (r = 0.922, P = 0.009)
