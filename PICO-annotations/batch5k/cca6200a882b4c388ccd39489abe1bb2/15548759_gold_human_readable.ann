subjects with cardiovascular risk.
Participants 427 581 9
Subjects were two groups of middle-aged men differing in cardiovascular risk; 46 survivors of myocardial infarction before age 50 and 60 healthy controls.
Participants 676 740 3
Twenty-eight patients and 58 controls completed the intervention
Participants 1275 1449 6
Homocysteine levels in subjects with the TT variant genotype were significantly higher compared with CT or CC (P = 0.001), especially in subjects with low folate (P = 0.012).
Participants 1621 1799 4
In antioxidant-supplemented myocardial infarction survivors we found an increase in the ferric reducing ability of plasma (P < 0.001) and a decrease in malondialdehyde (P = 0.001
Participants 1802 1903 3
Micronucleus frequency showed a decrease, strongest in subjects with normal folate levels (P = 0.015)
Participants 1908 2113 3
subjects with low folate levels, a high correlation was found between micronuclei after supplementation and homocysteine, both before (r = 0.979, P = 0.002) and after supplementation (r = 0.922, P = 0.009)
