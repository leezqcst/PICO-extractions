T1	Participants 0 96	The effects of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on the sleep need of sedentary young adults
T2	Participants 1354 1476	Two findings emerged: vigorous exercise did not increase sleep need; however, this level of exercise increased light sleep
T3	Participants 561 693	We investigated the role of exercise on the sleep need of sedentary adults, after controlling for exercise mode, timing and duration
T4	Participants 288 559	Objective studies investigating exercise-sleep responses have produced mixed outcomes, and the disparity in results between studies may be due to differences in individual characteristics and/or exercise protocol, emphasising the importance of carefully controlled trials
