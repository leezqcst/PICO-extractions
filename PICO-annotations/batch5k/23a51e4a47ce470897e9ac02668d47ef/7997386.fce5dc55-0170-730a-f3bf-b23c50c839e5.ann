T1	Participants 1161 1327	CONCLUSIONS Fructose-1,6-diphosphate produces a modest but significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.
T2	Participants 839 976	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Fructose-1,6-diphosphate resulted in a modest 7% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.05).
T3	Participants 244 305	DESIGN Prospective, randomized, single-blind, parallel study.
T4	Participants 123 242	STUDY OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of fructose-1,6-diphosphate on myocardial performance using nuclear scintigraphy
T5	Participants 0 120	Effect of intravenous fructose-1,6-diphosphate on myocardial contractility in patients with left ventricular dysfunction
