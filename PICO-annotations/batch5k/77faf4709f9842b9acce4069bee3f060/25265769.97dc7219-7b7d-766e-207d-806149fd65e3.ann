T1	Participants 1834 2257	CONCLUSION The level of absence of cold sensation, level of pinprick analgesia, and time to achieve sensory block to T4 level were statistically higher in patients receiving hyperbaric bupivacaine than in patients receiving plain bupivacaine and plain levobupivacaine, while the differences were not statistically significant in all groups regarding effective surgical anesthesia, postoperative analgesia, and side effects.
T2	Participants 1148 1200	RESULTS Demographic data were similar in all groups.
T3	Participants 489 576	This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was approved by the Ethics Committee
T4	Participants 277 468	Compare the effects of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 10 mg with intrathecal bupivacaine 11 mg and intrathecal levobupivacaine 11 mg, all with 10 microg of fentanyl, for cesarean section.
T5	Participants 0 75	Comparison of intrathecal bupivacaine, levobupivacaine for cesarean section
T6	Participants 89 265	Some investigators found a greater incidence of hypotension in patients receiving intrathecal hyperbaric solution than in patients receiving plain solution for cesarean section
