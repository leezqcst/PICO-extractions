CONCLUSION The level of absence of cold sensation, level of pinprick analgesia, and time to achieve sensory block to T4 level were statistically higher in patients receiving hyperbaric bupivacaine than in patients receiving plain bupivacaine and plain levobupivacaine, while the differences were not statistically significant in all groups regarding effective surgical anesthesia, postoperative analgesia, and side effects.
