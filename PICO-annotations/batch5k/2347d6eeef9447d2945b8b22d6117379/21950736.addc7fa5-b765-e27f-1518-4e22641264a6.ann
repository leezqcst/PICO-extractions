T1	Participants 825 928	A haplotype analysis of eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ADORA2A was performed in 82 volunteers
T2	Participants 0 153	Polymorphisms of ADORA2A modulate psychomotor vigilance and the effects of caffeine on neurobehavioural performance and sleep EEG after sleep deprivation
T3	Participants 930 1153	In 45 young men carrying five different allele combinations, we investigated the effects of prolonged waking and 2 × 200 mg caffeine or 2 × 100 mg modafinil on psychomotor vigilance, sleepiness, and the waking and sleep EEG
