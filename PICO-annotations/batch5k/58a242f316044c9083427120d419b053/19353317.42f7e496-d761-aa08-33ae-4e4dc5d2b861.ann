T1	Participants 1277 1398	CONCLUSION No implant or surgical technique is superior to any other under all circumstances for distal femoral fracture.
T2	Participants 874 997	RESULTS With respect to operation time, the DCS group presented significantly better results than the RIMSN group (p=0.000)
T3	Participants 597 758	METHODS From September 2002 to December 2004, 68 closed fractures of the distal femur were treated by bridge plate osteosynthesis using DCS in 31 and RIMSN in 37
T4	Participants 227 320	BACKGROUND The treatment of distal femoral fractures remains a significant surgical challenge
T5	Participants 0 224	Bridge plate osteosynthesis using dynamic condylar screw (DCS) or retrograde intramedullary supracondylar nail (RIMSN) in the treatment of distal femoral fractures: comparison of two methods in a prospective randomized study
