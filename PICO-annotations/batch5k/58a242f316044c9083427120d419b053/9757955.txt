Compliance with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate: a randomized, controlled trial of intensive reminders.

We enrolled women in a prospective, randomized study to determine whether an intensive reminder system would improve compliance in women receiving depot medroxyprogesterone injections. Women selecting this treatment were assigned to a group that received both mail and telephone reminders or to a second group that received only a scheduled appointment at the time of the previous injection. The rate of continuation and the rate of on-time injections did not differ between groups. Women who had prolonged bleeding were more likely to discontinue depot medroxyprogesterone injections.
