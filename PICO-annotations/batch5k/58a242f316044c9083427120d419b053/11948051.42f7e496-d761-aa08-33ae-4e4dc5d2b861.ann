T1	Participants 1597 1929	CONCLUSIONS Two cycles of regional 2-min IP in the LAD, followed by 3 min of reperfusion, proved to be applicable and safe in patients undergoing off-pump myocardial revascularization, it tended to decrease the immediate myocardial enzyme release, it prohibited the postoperative increase in HR, and it enhanced the recovery of SVI.
T2	Participants 751 965	MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Registration included hemodynamic data from the peripheral artery and the pulmonary artery, and the measurement of cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) values.
T3	Participants 376 587	PATIENTS Thirty-two patients with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) or two-vessel heart disease (including LAD) who were to undergo off-pump CABG were randomized into an IP group and a control group
T4	Participants 112 291	OBJECTIVES We intended to investigate whether ischemic preconditioning (IP) enhances myocardial performance in patients who undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
