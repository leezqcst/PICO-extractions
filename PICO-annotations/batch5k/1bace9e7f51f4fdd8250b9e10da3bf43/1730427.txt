Stage II carcinoma of the ovary: an analysis of survival after comprehensive surgical staging and adjuvant therapy.

Ninety-three women with FIGO stage II epithelial ovarian carcinoma underwent comprehensive surgical staging and were randomized prospectively to therapy consisting of either intraperitoneal radioactive phosphorus or oral melphalan. No patient had gross residual disease at the time of randomization. Ten of the forty-five women treated with melphalan experienced severe bone marrow depression at some time during therapy and two women expired from leukemia. Four of the forty-eight women treated with intraperitoneal phosphorus required surgical reexploration for intestinal obstruction or bowel injury. Twenty-one women died of their disease. Survival was not statistically different between the two treatment arms. The 5-year actuarial survival was 78%.
