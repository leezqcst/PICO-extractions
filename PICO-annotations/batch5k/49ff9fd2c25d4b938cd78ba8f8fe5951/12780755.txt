Short-term effects of prednisolone and dexamethasone on circulating concentrations of leptin and sex hormone-binding globulin in children being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

OBJECTIVE Disturbances in body weight regulation are often encountered during glucocorticoid treatment and are associated with increased insulin resistance and truncal fat accumulation. Children were investigated who were receiving glucocorticoid treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). They were randomized to receive either prednisolone or dexamethasone as part of induction of remission. This randomization process provided a suitable opportunity to compare the effects of these two administered steroid on surrogate markers of adipocyte activity (leptin) and hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance (SHBG).
DESIGN AND PATIENTS Prospective study over 16 weeks of children randomized to receive prednisolone (40 mg/m2) or dexamethasone (6.5 mg/m2) as part of the MRC-ALL97/99 induction chemotherapy for ALL. Nineteen children (8 male, 11 female) with a median age 5.9 years (range 2.6-13 years) were recruited into the study. Main outcome measures were body mass index (BMI), serum leptin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).
RESULTS Glucocorticoid administration for 5 weeks resulted in significant (P < 0.05) increases in BMI, leptin (corrected for BMI) and the leptin : SHBG ratio and lowering of SHBG. Dose for dose, dexamethasone was significantly more potent than prednisolone in altering these parameters.
CONCLUSIONS Short-term glucocorticoid treatment has significant effects on BMI, leptin and SHBG. The leptin : SHBG ratio increase indicates that this may be a novel and sensitive biochemical marker of metabolic change. Our results suggest that glucocorticoid treatment regimens should be kept as short as possible to avoid possible detrimental effects associated with increased adiposity and insulin resistance.
