Direct trocar insertion vs. Verres needle use for laparoscopic sterilization.

A randomized, prospective trial was designed to compare direct trocar insertion with prior peritoneal insufflation with a Verres needle for laparoscopic tubal sterilization. Direct trocar insertion resulted in fewer instrument insertions (21.8% vs. 7.8%) and use of smaller volumes of CO2 (2.67 vs. 2.32 L). Direct trocar use resulted in a decrease in operating time from 9 minutes, 40 seconds in the needle group to 7 minutes, 30 seconds in the trocar group. Minor omental injuries occurred in a small percentage of each group, while serious complications occurred once in each group.
