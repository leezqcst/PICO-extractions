T1	Participants 675 717	61 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
T2	Participants 718 910	Patients were randomly divided in two groups: In group 1 (n = 41) postmenopausal women received oral risedronate (35 mg/week), calcium (1,000 mg/day), and vitamin D (400 IU/day) for 12 months.
T3	Participants 914 1023	group 2 (control group; n = 20) patients received only oral calcium (1,000 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day)
T4	Participants 1561 1622	group 1 (risedronate plus calcium/vitamin D-treated patients)
T5	Participants 1829 1915	group 2, however, the level of serum cytokines did not change after three and 6 months
T6	Participants 1917 2039	In cases of bone turnover, both markers of bone resorption and formation significantly decreased after 6 months in group 1
T7	Participants 1175 1396	Venous blood samples were obtained for determination of serum cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), RANKL, osteoprotegerin, and markers of bone formation and resorption
T8	Participants 289 395	Treatment with risedronate is accompanied by significant changes in bone turnover and bone mineral density
T9	Participants 606 644	postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
