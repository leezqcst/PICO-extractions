[Intra-arterial (5-FU/FA and FUDR) versus systemic chemotherapy (5-FU/FA) of non-resectable colorectal liver metastases].

The relative efficacy of HAI FUDR, HAI 5-FU/FA, and i.v. 5-FU/FA chemotherapy for the treatment of unresectable colorectal liver metastases was compared in a prospective randomized clinical trial. The response rate after HAI treatment was significantly higher as compared to i.v. treatment with no statistical benefit regarding survival and time to progression. HAI FUDR treatment was inferior as compared to HAI or i.v. 5-FU/FA. i.v. 5-FU/FA-therapy is therefore the method of choice outside clinical trials.
