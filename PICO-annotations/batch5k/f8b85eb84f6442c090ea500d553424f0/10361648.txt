Effects of a videotape information intervention at discharge on diet and exercise compliance after coronary bypass surgery.

BACKGROUND This study evaluated the relative effects on compliance with recommended lifestyle changes of two experimental videotapes that involved different approaches for preparing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients for the posthospital recovery period. The tapes differed in the extent to which they portrayed the recovery period as a steady, forward progression versus a series of "ups and downs."
METHODS Two hundred sixteen male and female CABG patients were assigned randomly either to view one of the two videotapes before discharge from the hospital or to receive only the standard discharge preparation provided by the hospital. All patients completed measures of anxiety and self-efficacy at discharge, 1 month and 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Patients also completed measures of dietary fat consumption and activity level 1 and 3 months after discharge.
RESULTS Relative to controls, patients who viewed either of the videotapes before hospital release reported higher self-efficacy for adhering to the recommended low-fat diet both at discharge and 1 month after surgery. Viewing either of the videotapes also resulted in significantly less dietary fat intake 1 month after hospital release compared with controls. Patients who viewed the tape that portrayed the recovery period as consisting of ups and downs also reported significantly more frequent moderate exercise at 1 month and more frequent strenuous exercise 3 months after discharge.
CONCLUSIONS The experimental videotapes proved to be an effective method for increasing dietary and exercise compliance during the first 3 months after CABG.
