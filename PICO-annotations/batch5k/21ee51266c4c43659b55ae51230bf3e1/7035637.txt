Age-related response to two Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.

Two types of Hib vaccines were compared for efficacy and safety in 71 normal children in three age groups: 36 to 72 months, 15 to 18 months, and 6 to 8 months. One vaccine contained the Hib-specific capsular polysaccharide, PRP; the second vaccine contained PRP combined with pertussis vaccine, PRP-P. A third vaccine, DTP, was administered to a control group for each age. Anti-PRP antibody levels were greater after vaccination with PRP-P than after PRP in all three age groups. Immunoresponsiveness to both vaccines increased with age. A lower incidence of side effects was seen with both PRP (15%) and PRP-P (20%) than with DTP (56%). The results suggest that PRP-P is both well tolerated clinically and has greater immunogenicity than PRP.
