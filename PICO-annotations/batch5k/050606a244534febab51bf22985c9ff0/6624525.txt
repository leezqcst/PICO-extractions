Double contrast arthrography of the knee. Comparison between three contrast media.

Meglumine iothalamate (Conray Meglumin), sodium-calcium-meglumine metrizoate (Isopaque Cerebral) and dimeglumine iocarmate (Dimerex), each containing about 280 mg I/ml, were compared in two series of double contrast knee arthrography, 190 and 184 patients each. With Dimerex the mixing of the contrast medium with the synovial fluid was slower than with Conray Meglumin, and a good or fair image quality, as evaluated subjectively, lasted longer. No difference was observed between Isopaque Cerebral and Conray Meglumin, regardless of dosage.
