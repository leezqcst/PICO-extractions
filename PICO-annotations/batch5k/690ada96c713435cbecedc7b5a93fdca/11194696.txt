Increasing the reach of health sponsorship: using a "sponsorship kit" to promote health.

In Australia, a tobacco tax provides funding for Healthway, the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation. Healthway provides sponsorships for the arts and racing and sporting events to replace funds previously provided by tobacco companies. These sponsorships provide visibility for Healthway and positive health messages. Normally, Healthway staff attends these events to help promote health messages. To reduce Healthway staff time spent helping event organizers promote health messages, Healthway developed a sponsor kit of promotional materials which communicate health messages without requiring Healthway staff to attend events. Recognition, awareness, comprehension, and acceptance of health messages was comparable at events that featured Healthway staff versus the sponsor kits, but the average cost of the sponsorship kits was only 40% of the cost when Healthway staff was featured.
