A fenbendazole oral drench in addition to an ivermectin pour-on reduces parasite burden and improves feedlot and carcass performance of finishing heifers compared with endectocides alone.

Two studies utilizing 1,862 yearling heifers were conducted to determine the effects of a fenbendazole oral drench in addition to an ivermectin pour-on (SG+IVPO), compared with an ivermectin pour-on (IVPO) or a doramectin injectable (DMX) alone, on parasite burden, feedlot performance, and carcass merit of feedlot cattle. In the first study, heifers receiving the SG+IVPO had fewer (P = 0.02) cattle retreated for disease and 73% fewer (P = 0.06) worm eggs per fecal sample 98 d after treatment than heifers treated with IVPO. Heifers treated with SG+IVPO consumed more DM, had greater ADG, were heavier at slaughter, and had heavier carcasses than IVPO-treated heifers (P < 0.05). Heifers treated with SG+IVPO also had more (P = 0.07) carcasses grading USDA Prime or Choice than IVPO-treated heifers. In the second study, heifers treated with SG+IVPO had fewer (P < 0.01) worm eggs per fecal sample 35 d after treatment and had fewer numbers of adult and larval Cooperia and Trichostrongylus spp. in the small intestine at slaughter (P < 0.10) compared with heifers treated with DMX. Heifers treated with SG+IVPO consumed more DM, were heavier at slaughter, and had heavier carcasses than DMX-treated heifers (P < 0.01). The SG+IVPO-treated heifers also had greater ADG (P < 0.10). The broad-spectrum effectiveness of a combination of a fenbendazole oral drench and an ivermectin pour-on reduced parasite burden and increased feed intake, ADG, and carcass weight in feedlot heifers compared with treatment with an endectocide alone.
