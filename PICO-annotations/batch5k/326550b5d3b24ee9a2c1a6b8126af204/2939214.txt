Comparison of ketanserin and pindolol in hypertension.

The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin (40 mg twice daily) and pindolol (5 mg twice daily) as monotherapy were compared in a crossover, double-blind trial in 17 patients with essential hypertension. Both ketanserin and pindolol decreased supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly (P less than 0.01 for systolic and P less than 0.001 for diastolic) when evaluated at the end of the 2-month treatment periods. There was no significant difference between the two drugs. No significant changes in heart rate were observed on either drug. Both drugs were well tolerated.
