patients with cancerous pleurisy. A total of 53 patients were accessed to the study: 29 patients for the OK-432 group and 24 patients for the control group. Intrapleural instillation of 50 mg of adriamycin and a combination chemotherapy of MFC (mitomycin C 0.08 mg/kg, 5-FU 10 mg/kg, ara-C 0.8 mg/kg iv, weekly) were administered in both groups. In the OK-432 group intrapleural instillation of 2 units of OK-432 was administered daily until disappearance of pleural effusion; thereafter, 2 to 5 units of OK-432 were administered intradermally every other day.
