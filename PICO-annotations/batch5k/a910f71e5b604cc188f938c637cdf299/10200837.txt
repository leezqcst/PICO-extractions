Behavioral and physiological effects of deep pressure on children with autism: a pilot study evaluating the efficacy of Grandin's Hug Machine.

OBJECTIVE One symptom common to many persons with autism is a high arousal or anxiety level. This study investigated the effects of deep pressure on arousal and anxiety reduction in autism with Grandin's Hug Machine, a device that allows self-administration of lateral body pressure.
METHOD Twelve children with autism were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (receiving deep pressure) or a placebo group (not receiving deep pressure but in the disengaged Hug Machine). All children received two 20-min sessions a week over a 6-week period. Arousal was measured behaviorally with the Conners Parent Rating Scale and physiologically with galvanic skin response (GSR) readings.
RESULTS Behavioral results indicated a significant reduction in tension and a marginally significant reduction in anxiety for children who received the deep pressure compared with the children who did not. Additionally, children in the experimental group, whose GSR measures decreased, on average, after deep pressure, were somewhat more likely to have higher GSR arousal a priori.
CONCLUSION These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that deep pressure may have a calming effect for persons with autism, especially those with high levels of arousal or anxiety.
