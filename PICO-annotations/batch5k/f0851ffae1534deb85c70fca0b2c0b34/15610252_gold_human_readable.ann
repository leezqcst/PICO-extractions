Participants 453 618 5
METHODS This study evaluated patients with and without kidney disease [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) presenting with acute dyspnea.
Participants 621 711 6
total of 452 consecutive patients (240 with kidney disease and 212 without kidney disease)
