T1	Participants 1389 1625	CONCLUSION When applying BNP cut-off values without adjustment for the presence of kidney disease, the use of BNP levels does significantly improve the management of patients without kidney disease, but not of those with kidney disease.
T2	Participants 861 1057	RESULTS Patients with kidney disease were older, more often had CHF as the cause of acute dyspnea, and more often died in-hospital or within 30 days as compared to patients without kidney disease.
T3	Participants 453 618	METHODS This study evaluated patients with and without kidney disease [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) presenting with acute dyspnea.
T4	Participants 118 277	BACKGROUND B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are reliably elevated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and therefore helpful in its diagnosis
