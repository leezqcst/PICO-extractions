Twenty-two volunteers over 60 years of age participated in the present study. The sample was randomly divided in an experimental group of 13 older subjects (3 men and 10 women, mean age 63.5 +/- 3 years) while the remaining 9 subjects (3 men and 6 women, mean age 64.2 +/- 4 years) served as inactive control group. After medical screening all participants were evaluated before and after 12 weeks in which the experimental subjects underwent a low intensity training.
