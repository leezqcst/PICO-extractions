Low intensity physical training in older subjects.

BACKGROUND This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a low intensity general training program (< 50% of heart rate reserve) on physical fitness of healthy older subjects, by comparing maximal and submaximal indices of training response.
METHODS Twenty-two volunteers over 60 years of age participated in the present study. The sample was randomly divided in an experimental group of 13 older subjects (3 men and 10 women, mean age 63.5 +/- 3 years) while the remaining 9 subjects (3 men and 6 women, mean age 64.2 +/- 4 years) served as inactive control group. After medical screening all participants were evaluated before and after 12 weeks in which the experimental subjects underwent a low intensity training. Each subjects-either inactive or active-performed two treadmill tests at two-days interval, to measure maximal and submaximal responses to exercise, respectively. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2) and pulmonary ventilation (VE) were measured using a telemetric apparatus.
RESULTS The major finding of the study was the significant improvement in submaximal response to exercise of experimental subjects, expressed by the reduction in HR, VO2 VE while VO2 max did not change.
CONCLUSIONS Thus, it appears that a low intensity general training similar to that followed in the present study may represent a good means to improve physical fitness in healthy elderly people. Similarly, this study supports the effectiveness of evaluation tests based on submaximal responses to exercise in this population.
