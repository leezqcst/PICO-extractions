Effect of ozone application on the resin-dentin microtensile bond strength.

When ozone is used during caries treatment, bond strength can be compromised by the release of oxygen. The use of antioxidant agents neutralizes the free oxygen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ozone and sodium ascorbate on resin-dentin microtensile bond strength (μTBS). Forty human third molars were divided into four groups: Group 1, not treated with ozone; Group 2, ozone application followed by acid etching; Group 3, acid etching followed by ozone application; and Group 4, ozone and application of sodium ascorbate. Bonded beams (1.0 mm(2)) were tested under tension (0.5 mm min(-1)). The μTBS values were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test (p=0.05). All beams that fractured were analyzed under stereomicroscopy (40×). Group 1 had significantly higher μTBS values than Group 2 or 3. The μTBS values of Groups 1 and 4 were similar and higher than those of Group 2. The use of ozone in Group 2 resulted in lower values of μTBS in all conditions evaluated. The predominant failure mode was adhesive. The application of ozone decreased the μTBS of the dentin-composite resin interface. These values were reversed when compared with Groups 1 and 2 when sodium ascorbate was used.
