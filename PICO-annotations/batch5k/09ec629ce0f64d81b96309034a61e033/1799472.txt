Randomized study of chlorambucil (CB) compared to interferon (alfa-2b) combined with CB in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: an interim report of a randomized study. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cooperative Study Group.

Alpha interferon has shown initial promise in the treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), especially with the nodular form of the disease. The present study enrolled 70 NHL patients who received either chlorambucil (CB; 10 mg/day) or CB plus interferon alfa-2b (5 million units (MU)/m2 subcutaneously three times a week). Among 63 evaluable patients, similar response rates (62.1% and 64.7% respectively) were recorded for the treatment arms. In patients receiving no maintenance therapy, those who received interferon alfa-2b during the induction phase showed a favourable trend in terms of incidence of relapse compared to those who had received chlorambucil alone. During maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b, no significant differences in the occurrence of relapse have yet been seen compared to patients on no maintenance therapy. A longer observation period is needed to make a definitive conclusion about the usefulness of interferon maintenance therapy and to evaluate further the effects of the combined schedule of chlorambucil and interferon induction on the duration of remission.
