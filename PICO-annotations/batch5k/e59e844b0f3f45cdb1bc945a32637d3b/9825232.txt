Succinate sumatriptan evaluation by Doppler echocardiography in patients with migraine.

Recent reports show that sumatriptan administration increases blood pressure and vascular resistance both in systemic and pulmonary circulation. This study was performed to evaluate by echo-Doppler technique the hemodynamic effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan administration. Forty-one migraine subjects (26 males, 15 females), mean age 36 +/- 2 years (range 36-39 years), and 20 healthy control subjects (14 males, six females), mean age 36 +/- 2 years (range 36-39 years) were randomized (double-blind) to receiving sumatriptan (group A) or placebo (group B). After a 2-week complete pharmacological washout, clinical examination, electrocardiogram, and Doppler echocardiography were performed at baseline, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after sumatriptan or placebo administration. No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding Doppler echocardiographic parameters (aortic integral, pulmonary integral, end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters) and heart rate; only a slight but not significant increase in arterial blood pressure was observed in group A. Our data show that succinate sumatriptan can be used with safety in patients without hypertension and other cardiovascular disease.
