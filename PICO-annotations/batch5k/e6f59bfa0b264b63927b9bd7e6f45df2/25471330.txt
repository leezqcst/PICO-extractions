Ranibizumab plus verteporfin photodynamic therapy in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: 12 months of retreatment and vision outcomes from a randomized study.

PURPOSE To investigate the injection frequency and visual acuity (VA) outcomes with combination therapy (ranibizumab plus verteporfin photodynamic therapy, PDT) versus monotherapy (ranibizumab).
METHODS A total of 40 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration were randomized 1:1 to ranibizumab 0.3 mg plus single standard verteporfin PDT or ranibizumab 0.3 mg plus sham PDT. Ranibizumab was administered 3 times monthly followed by 'as needed' to month 12 based on predetermined vision/anatomical criteria. Retreatment rates, VA outcomes and safety were assessed.
RESULTS During months 3-12, combination therapy patients required fewer ranibizumab injections (mean 1.3) compared with monotherapy patients (2.8). Mean VA improved by 9.0 letters with combination therapy versus 7.5 letters in the monotherapy group at month 12. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated.
CONCLUSION The need for ranibizumab retreatment might be reduced by administering a single verteporfin PDT on the same day as the first ranibizumab injection, without compromising VA outcomes or safety.
