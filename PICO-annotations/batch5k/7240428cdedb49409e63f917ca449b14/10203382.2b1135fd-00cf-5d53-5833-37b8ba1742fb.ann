DESIGN An observational substudy of an open-label randomized controlled trial of two alternative therapeutic regimens for MAC. SETTING Twenty-four hospital-based HIV clinics in 16 Canadian cities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures were survival and bacteriologic response, defined by consecutive negative blood cultures for MAC at least 2 weeks apart within 16 weeks of study entry. RESULTS Prior AIDS diagnosis, low Karnofsky score, active unstable AIDS-related conditions, absence of antiretroviral therapy and absence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis were associated with shorter survival by univariate regression using the proportional hazards model. On multivariate analysis, antiretroviral therapy was not an independent predictor of mortality, and previous rifabut
