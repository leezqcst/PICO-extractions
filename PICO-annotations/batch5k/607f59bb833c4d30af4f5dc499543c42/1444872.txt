[Unstable angina: comparison of the effects of diltiazem and propranolol].

PURPOSE To evaluate the effects of diltiazem and propranolol in patients with unstable angina.
METHODS Fifty-six patients with unstable angina, mean age of 55.4 +/- 8.5, 41 men and 15 women, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of two groups of patients treated with diltiazem or propranolol at total daily doses of 180 mg and 120 mg respectively during the first 48 hours. After that the total daily doses was adjusted to 240 mg and 160 mg, respectively, until the 7th day. The first 48 hours, four times daily, clinical evaluation, CKMB data, ECG were obtained and two times daily until 7th day. A coronary arteriography was done on study entry.
RESULTS A significative reduction of angina crisis number, duration, intensity and the number of sublingual nitrates doses were observed equally in both groups. The SAP, DAP, HR and RR did not show statistical differences between groups. Individual groups analysis showed significative reductions of SAP, DAP and HR in propranolol group. The CKMB data, ECG alterations and coronary arteriography characteristics were similar.
CONCLUSION Both drugs were effective for the unstable angina treatment.
