T1	Participants 34 154	prognostic value and therapeutic implication in intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
T2	Participants 169 308	advances in imaging and radiotherapy, the prognostic value of skull-base invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) needs to be reassessed.
T3	Participants 585 615	749 patients who underwent MRI
T4	Participants 625 709	subsequently histologically diagnosed with nondisseminated NPC and treated with IMRT
T5	Participants 809 933	overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), or disease-free survival
T6	Participants 1144 1305	5-year OS, DMFS, LRFS, and DFS rates in the classification of skull-base invasion in NPC were 83 vs. 67 %, 85 vs.75 %, 95 vs. 88 %, and 76 vs. 62 %, respectively
T7	Participants 1449 1560	MRI-detected skull-base invasion is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with NPC treated with IMRT
T8	Participants 1653 1817	patients with various subclassifications of stage T3 disease may receive treatment with different intensities; however, further studies are warranted to prove this.
