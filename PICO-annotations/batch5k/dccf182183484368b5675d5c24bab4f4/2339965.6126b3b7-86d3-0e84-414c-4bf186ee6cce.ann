T1	Participants 627 764	An average of 33% whole blood cholinesterase inhibition was induced in the pyridostigmine treated group 4 h after ingestion of last table
T2	Participants 1111 1605	No additional differences were found between treatments in the physiological responses and heat balance parameters at the end of exposure: heart rate (HR) was (mean +/- S.D.) 154 +/- 16 and 151 +/- 24 bpm, rectal temperature (Tre) was 39.0 +/- 0.4 and 38.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C, heat storage over the 2 h of exercise was 62 +/- 15 and 70 +/- 15 W.m-2, and sweat rate was 832 +/- 185 and 748 +/- 52 g.h-1, in the pyridostigmine and placebo treatments, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
