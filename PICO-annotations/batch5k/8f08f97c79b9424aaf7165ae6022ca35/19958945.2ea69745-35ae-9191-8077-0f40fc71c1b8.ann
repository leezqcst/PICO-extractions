T2	Participants 0 176;178 433	A prospective, randomized trial of nerve monitoring of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during thyroidectomy under local/regional anesthesia and IV sedation. BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the neuromonitoring of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) on the voice quality after mini-incision thyroidectomy under local/regional anesthesia and intravenous sedation
