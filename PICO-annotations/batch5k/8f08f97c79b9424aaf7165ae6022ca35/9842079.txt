[Clinical trial of 2 tobacco use cessation interventions in primary care].

OBJECTIVE To study the efficacy of two types of intervention to stop tobacco dependency.
DESIGN Randomised clinical trial.
SETTING Primary care centre.
PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS Smokers recruited from among the health centre users through the preventive activities and health promotion programme.
INTERVENTIONS 
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE type of intervention. General variables: age, sex, marital status, educational level, work situation, cohabitation with children, smokers at home, number of years smoking, type of tobacco. There were two types of intervention: a) Minimal Intervention (MI). b) Advanced Intervention (AI). 54 patients were included, with 6 losses. 21 were assigned at random to the MI group and 27 to the AI group. Progress was measured at 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and a year.
RESULTS In the MI, 23.8% were abstinent at 15 days; the same percentage at one month and 3 months; 19% at 6 months; and 14.3% remained abstinent after a year. In the AI, 51.9% were abstinent at 15 days; 48.1% at both one and 3 months; 25.9% at 6 months; and 22.2% were still not smoking after a year. No significant differences between the two interventions were found in any of the observations.
CONCLUSIONS These data do not show that one intervention is better than the other. With the passage of time the effect of the intervention decreased in both groups.
