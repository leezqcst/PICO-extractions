T1	Participants 1671 1815	CONCLUSION Thirteen weeks of moderate ST two or three times per week does not reduce central arterial compliance in middle-aged and older adults
T2	Participants 1100 1251	RESULTS ST performed alone, or in conjunction with aerobic exercise, improved maximal muscle strength and increased total lean body mass (both P<0.01).
T3	Participants 761 1098	METHODS Participants were rigorously screened for cardiovascular disease and underwent pre-post testing for carotid arterial compliance (via simultaneous ultrasound and applanation tonometry), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, plasma endothelin-1 and angiotensin II concentrations and carotid artery vasoreactivity (cold pressor test)
T4	Participants 393 539	OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of a ST program on central arterial compliance in middle-aged and older adults
T5	Participants 98 232	BACKGROUND Contrary to aerobic exercise, strength training (ST) is associated with decreased central arterial compliance in young men.
