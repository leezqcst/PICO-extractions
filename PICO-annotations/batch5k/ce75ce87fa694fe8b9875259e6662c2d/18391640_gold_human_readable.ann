BACKGROUND Contrary to aerobic exercise, strength training (ST) is associated with decreased central arterial compliance in young men.
Participants 548 760 5
Randomized, controlled intervention study in which 37 healthy, sedentary men and women (52+/-2 years) performed 13 weeks of ST (n=13), ST+aerobic exercise (n=12) or stretching exercises as a control group (n=12).
Participants 761 1099 3
METHODS Participants were rigorously screened for cardiovascular disease and underwent pre-post testing for carotid arterial compliance (via simultaneous ultrasound and applanation tonometry), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, plasma endothelin-1 and angiotensin II concentrations and carotid artery vasoreactivity (cold pressor test).
