The effect of Cys LT1 receptor blockade on airway responses to allergen.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a potent experimental leukotriene receptor antagonist, MK-571, on airway responses to inhaled allergen.
DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.
SETTING Clinical research center.
SUBJECTS Eight male volunteers with allergic asthma.
INTERVENTIONS An intravenous loading dose was followed by an 8-hour infusion of MK-571 or placebo, with a 7- to 14-day washout between treatments. Allergen challenge was performed after the loading dose and a histamine challenge was performed before and 24 hours after allergen.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Forced expiratory volume in 1 second was measured serially. MK-571 provided about 50% protection during maximum early and late responses compared with placebo (p=0.005), but airway obstruction persisted 8-24 hours after allergen on both treatment days. Airway responsiveness to histamine was not significantly attenuated at 24 hours.
CONCLUSION Blocking Cys LT1 receptors for 8 hours attenuated the early and late responses but did not interrupt the cascade of events leading to subsequent allergen-induced airway obstruction and hyperreactivity.
