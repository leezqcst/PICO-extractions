Tensile bond strength of a lithium-disilicate pressed glass ceramic to dentin of different surface treatments.

The effects of desensitizer, disinfectant, saliva, blood, and hydrogen peroxide on the tensile bond strength between adhesive and ceramic as well as between adhesive and dentin were examined. Sixty 7x3 mm pressed ceramic discs of IPS e.max were fabricated and randomly assigned to six groups of different dentin surface treatments (control, desensitizer, disinfectant, saliva, blood, and hydrogen peroxide). Representative samples of fractured specimens were observed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy). There were significant differences between the control group and saliva, blood, and hydrogen peroxide groups (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between any other dentin surface treatment groups (p>0.05). Results of this study suggested that only saliva, blood, and hydrogen peroxide influenced the tensile bond strength between dentin and ceramic.
