Effects of halothane and isoflurane on transient renal dysfunction associated with infrarenal aortic cross-clamping.

Aortic cross-clamping for reconstructive aortic surgery is associated with impairment of renal function. Halothane or isoflurane was used to assess the influence of volatile anesthesia on renal hemodynamics during aortic surgery. Nineteen patients with normal preoperative creatinine clearances who were scheduled for reconstructive aortic surgery were randomly divided into two groups: halothane group (n = 9) and isoflurane group (n = 10). Induction of anesthesia consisted of midazolam, fentanyl, and pancuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl and halothane or isoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (50/50). Systemic hemodynamics were similar in both groups throughout surgery. Before aortic cross-clamping, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) (131I-hippuran clearance) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (99Tc-DTPA clearance) were significantly lower in the halothane group (118.4 +/- 25.6 and 19.7 +/- 5.2 mL/min, respectively) than in the isoflurane group (253.4 +/- 51.5 and 44.9 +/- 8.4 mL/min) (P less than 0.05 for both). During cross-clamping, the renal variables were not markedly affected in either group and remained higher in the isoflurane-anesthetized patients (232.9 +/- 47.1 and 49.5 +/- 1.2 mL/min for ERPF and GFR, respectively) than in the halothane-anesthetized patients (132.4 +/- 31.6 and 14.8 +/- 3.7 mL/min, respectively) (P less than 0.05). After aortic unclamping, ERPF increased markedly in both groups (467.8 +/- 122 and 362.5 +/- 57.7 mL/min in the halothane and isoflurane groups, respectively), as did GFR (74.8 +/- 22 and 71.8 +/- 13.1 mL/min, respectively). These results suggest that anesthesia with halothane is associated with transient renal vasoconstriction during abdominal surgery. In contrast, aortic cross-clamping during isoflurane anesthesia was not associated with renal hemodynamic impairment.
