Video rating analysis of effect of maprotiline in patients with dementia and depression.

In patients with dementia and mild depression (DSM-III-R 290.21), the effect of low doses of the antidepressant maprotiline (up to 75 mg/d) was examined. The main parameter was a video rating of global impression. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were applied to evaluate the effect of maprotiline on cognitive and depressive symptoms. The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was of eight weeks' duration and included 127 patients, randomized in two groups. The antidepressant effect of maprotiline was reflected in the GDS. There was, however, no indication of an effect of maprotiline on cognitive performance. The global impression, evaluated by video rating, gave no indication as to a beneficial effect of the treatment. - The video analysis showed a significant interrater reliability. The discrepancy between the results of the video rating and the GDS is discussed. - The results confirm similar findings of other authors; i.e., that a sedating antidepressant with some anticholinergic effects cannot be expected to improve cognitive functions despite its antidepressant effect. The main interest of this study, however, lies in its methodology (video analysis).
