Nimodipine pharmacotherapeutic adjuvant therapy for inpatient treatment of cocaine dependence.

Recent preclinical studies suggest utility for voltage-sensitive calcium channel blockers (VSCCBs) in the treatment of cocaine addiction. The following double-blind placebo-controlled study examined the role of the VSCCB nimodipine in attenuating cocaine craving in 66 recently abstinent cocaine-dependent patients on an inpatient substance abuse treatment unit utilizing an intensive 12-step milieu-oriented psychosocial therapy. While the medication was well tolerated, the dose of nimodipine used in this study (90 mg q.d.) was not superior to placebo in reducing background or cue-induced cocaine craving over the 3 weeks of the study. There was the suggestion that nimodipine might attenuate the severity of some cocaine-induced brain deficits, as detected by evaluation of smooth pursuit eye movement function. A rationale for evaluating higher doses of nimodipine for the treatment of cocaine addiction is presented. As nimodipine might have anticraving and mood-stabilizing properties and cardio- and neuroprotective properties in the face of cocaine intoxication and might possibly even reverse some cocaine-induced brain deficits, further investigation of the role of nimodipine (and other VSCCBs) in cocaine addiction appears an attractive avenue of future medication development.
