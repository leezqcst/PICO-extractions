Comparison of sedative drugs under peribulbar or topical anesthesia during phacoemulsification.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To compare dexmedetomidine and midazolam+fentanyl sedation primarily based on patient satisfaction during phacoemulsification under topical and peribulbar anesthesia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective, randomized, and double-blind study of 80 American Society of Anesthesiology grade I-II patients who underwent phacoemulsification with local anesthesia under sedation. Patients were divided into four groups (20 patients for each): dexmedetomidine and topical anesthesia, dexmedetomidine and peribulbar anesthesia, midazolam+fentanyl and topical anesthesia, and midazolam+fentanyl and peribulbar anesthesia. Patient and surgeon satisfaction were determined on a 5-point scale. The pain was determined by verbal pain scale intraoperatively and postoperatively. Drugs were given to a Ramsay sedation scale of 3. Topical and peribulbar anesthesia were performed by an ophthalmologist. Hemodynamic, respiratory, and intraocular pressure monitoring was done. Operative and recovery times were recorded.
RESULTS In the midazolam+fentanyl groups, better patient and surgeon satisfaction scores were obtained (P < .005), verbal pain scale scores were significantly lower (P < .001), and patients needed less postoperative analgesia. Ramsay sedation scale scores were between 3 and 4 in all patients and there were no significant differences. Intraocular pressure alterations were similar between groups. Recovery time was longer in the dexmedetomidine groups (P < .05).
CONCLUSION The study demonstrated that the midazolam+fentanyl combination provided high-level patient satisfaction scores, low-level pain scores, and shorter recovery time. Also, both of the peribulbar and topical anesthesia procedures showed similar efficiency.
