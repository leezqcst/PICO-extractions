T1	Participants 1373 1608	CONCLUSION It appears likely that mitomycin C plus doxorubicin instillation has an equivalent efficacy to BCG as the initial therapy of carcinoma in situ and the combination of them would be the most efficient treatment for the disease
T2	Participants 814 1001	RESULTS Both topical therapies were equally effective with initial response rates of 86% (18/21) for BCG and 81% (17/21) for mitomycin C plus doxorubicin, irrespective of the tumor grade.
T3	Participants 446 650	METHODS Forty-two patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder were randomized to intravesical BCG (21 patients) or mitomycin C plus doxorubicin sequential therapy (21 patients) as first line treatment.
T4	Participants 140 360	BACKGROUND To elucidate the most efficient topical therapy for carcinoma in situ of the bladder, the efficacy of intravesical mitomycin C plus doxorubicin therapy was compared with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy.
T5	Participants 755 813	Of the patients, 27 had grade 2 and 15 had grade 3 cancer.
