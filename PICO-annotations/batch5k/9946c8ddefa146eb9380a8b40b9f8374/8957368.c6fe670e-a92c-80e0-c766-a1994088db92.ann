T1	Participants 1235 1378	CONCLUSIONS Video-assisted thoracoscopic talc insufflation has not been shown to be a superior approach compared with talc slurry in our study.
T2	Participants 967 1233	RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients with respect to age, sex ratio, chest drainage duration, postprocedural hospital stay, parenteral narcotics requirement, complications, or procedure failure (ie, recurrence)
T3	Participants 264 446	METHODS We designed a prospective, randomized study to compare video-assisted thoracoscopic talc insufflation with bedside talc slurry in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion.
