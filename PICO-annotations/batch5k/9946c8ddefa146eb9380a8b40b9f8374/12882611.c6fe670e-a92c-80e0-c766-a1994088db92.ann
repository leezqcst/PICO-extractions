T1	Participants 102 491	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Over the last few decades, application of ultrasound has been attempted to enhance transdermal transport of several drugs, a method referred to as "phonophoresis." The purposes of this study were to examine the influence of ultrasound on the transdermal delivery of ketoprofen in humans and to compare the concentrations found after continuous and pulsed application
T2	Participants 493 616	SUBJECTS AND METHODS Twenty-six patients with knee disorders requiring arthroscopy were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups.
T3	Participants 1243 1323	RESULTS The concentration of ketoprofen in plasma was negligible in all 3 groups
T4	Participants 1637 1805	DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This study confirms that phonophoresis of ketoprofen allows the attainment of higher local concentrations, whereas systemic exposure is lower.
T5	Participants 1807 1930	he results indicate that, in contrast to sham phonopheresis, ultrasound can increase the transdermal delivery of ketoprofen
