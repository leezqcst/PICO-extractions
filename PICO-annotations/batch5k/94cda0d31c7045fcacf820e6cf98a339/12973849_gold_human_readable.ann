Between 1985 and 1991, 250 children with institutionally classified high-grade gliomas were enrolled on CCG-945.
Participants 668 990 11
Patients older than 24 months with intracranial lesions were assigned randomly to receive either lomustine, vincristine, and prednisone (control regimen) or the 8-drugs-in-1-day regimen (experimental regimen); younger patients and those with primary spinal cord tumors were assigned nonrandomly to the experimental regimen

RESULTS The study involved 42 males and 28 females (median age, 7.7 years) with a median follow-up of 10.4 years
