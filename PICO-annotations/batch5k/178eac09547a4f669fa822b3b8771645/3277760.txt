Randomized study of six umbilical cord care regimens. Comparing length of attachment, microbial control, and satisfaction.

Two hundred and seventy one infants were enrolled in a study to compare six different methods of treating the umbilical cord. Antimicrobial control was equal for all methods. Repeated triple dye application was considered least acceptable by staff and parents and had the longest attachment time. Povidone-iodine was associated with the shortest attachment time and was most liked. If there is no special need to treat a specific nosocomial outbreak, duration of cord attachment and satisfaction of staff and parents can help clinicians decide on a cord care regimen.
