Methylphenidate and baseball playing in ADHD children: who's on first?

The effects of 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg methylphenidate were analyzed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in which 17 boys (ages 7.8-9.9 years) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) played in baseball games. Drug effects were evaluated on children's attention during the game, as indicated by their on-task behavior on the field and their ability to answer questions about the status of the game at all times. Judgment during batting, batting skill during the game, and performance on skill drills prior to the game were also assessed as a function of medication. Results revealed that methylphenidate had a beneficial effect on attending during the game.
