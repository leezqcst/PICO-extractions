[A randomized study of prophylactic intravesical instillation of pirarubicin (THP) prior to transurethral resection of superficial bladder cancer].

A prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic intravesical instillation of pirarubicin (THP) prior to transurethral resection (TUR) of superficial bladder cancer. A total of 63 patients were randomized into two groups, the THP group and the control group. In the THP group, 30 mg of THP dissolved in 50 ml saline was administered 4 times intravesically for 4 consecutive days before TUR. In the control group, no instillation was performed before TUR. The patients were followed by cystoscopy and urinary cytology every 3 months. The non-recurrence rates in the THP group and control group were 54.1% versus 37.6% at 1 year and 40.4% versus 26.8% at 2 years, respectively (P = 0.086). Time to recurrence for tumors larger than 1 cm was significantly longer in the THP group (P = 0.0137). Time to recurrence for single and grade 1+2 tumors tended to be longer in the THP group (P = 0.09, P = 0.079). No significant adverse effects were observed in any patient. Our findings suggest that intravesical THP instillation prior to TUR would be effective for patients with single, low grade lesions larger than 1 cm of superficial bladder cancer.
