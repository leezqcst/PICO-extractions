T1	Participants 43 87	arterial stiffness and central haemodynamics
T2	Participants 431 641	measures of arterial stiffness (aortic and brachial PWV), and on central haemodynamics [including augmented pressure (AP), AIx], and aortic reservoir components [including reservoir and excess pressures (P ex)]
T3	Participants 644 813	ixteen healthy volunteers (10 men, age 43 ± 19 years; mean ± SD) were randomised to be studied under conditions of 12 °C (mild-cold) and 21 °C (control) on separate days
T4	Participants 1584 1640	mild-cold exposure increases central haemodynamic stress
