T1	Participants 2030 2089	CONCLUSION G-CSF can increase CDI in high-risk childhood AL
T2	Participants 2174 2233	In our study, a higher CDI did not improve disease control.
T3	Participants 1241 1402	RESULTS CDI was significantly increased in the G-CSF group compared with the non-G-CSF group (mean +/- 95% confidence interval, 105 +/- 5% v 91 +/- 4%; P <.001).
T4	Participants 446 620	PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-seven children with very high-risk ALL were randomized (slow early response to therapy, 55 patients; translocation t(9;22) or t(4;11), 12 patients)
T5	Participants 182 445	PURPOSE To determine whether the use of a recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ([G-CSF] lenogastrim) can increase the chemotherapy dose-intensity (CDI) delivered during consolidation chemotherapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
