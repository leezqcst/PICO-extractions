[The value of local administration of antibiotics in treatment of bone infections].

An open, controlled, randomized clinical investigation was carried out in 33 patients suffering from osteomyelitis. In the first group, 17 patients, a through drainage with sterile physiologic solution was applied, while in the second group, 16 patients, antibiotic was added to the sterile physiologic solution. In all patients values of C reactive protein (CRP) in the blood were examined, and later on every third day after the operation. A significant difference of average values of CRP between the 3rd and 21st day in both groups of patients was established, as well as the similarity in average values of CRP, which points to the fact that the mechanical effect of through drainage is dominant, speaking about rinsing focus of infection and eliminating necrotic tissues and small sequesters.
