[Relationship between sCD44v6 expression and TCM differentiation type of gastric carcinoma patients and influence of weitai capsule on the expression].

OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship of TCM type with serum level of soluble CD44v6 (sCD44v6) and different histologic parameters in gastric carcinoma patients and to observe the influence of Weitai capsule (WTC) on the sCD44v6 expression.
METHODS TCM typing and sCD44v6 expression were determined in all the enrolled patients (30 in the control and 32 in the trial group) before operation, and 3-4 courses of chemotherapy was applied to them from 3-4 weeks after operation. To the patients of trial group, oral administration of WTC was given additionally with 4 capsules, 3 times a day for consecutive 3 months.
RESULTS sCD44v6 was significantly positive correlated with the degree of cancer cell differentiation, infiltration and lymph node metastasis; (2) Level of sCD44v6 was the highest in patients of blood stasis type, as compared with that in the patients of Pi-deficiency type or of damp-heat type, the difference was significant; (3) After ending treatment, level of sCD44v6 in the trial group was significantly lower than that in the control group.
CONCLUSION (1) Serum level of sCD44v6 could be taken as the criterion for evaluating the development and prognosis of gastric cancer, as well as the therapeutic target for anti-metastasis treatment; (2) Serum level of sCD44v6 is related to some extent with TCM type of blood stasis and Pi-deficiency; (3) WTC combined with chemotherapy could further inhibit the expression of serum sCD44v6 in gastric carcinoma patients.
