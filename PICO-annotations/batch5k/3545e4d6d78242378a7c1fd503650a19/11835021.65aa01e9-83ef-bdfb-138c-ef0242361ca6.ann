T1	Participants 1607 1728	CONCLUSION The results of LESS should facilitate the development of algorithms for programming ICD energy safety margins.
T2	Participants 1207 1288	RESULTS Enrollment is complete (702 patients), but follow-up results are pending.
T3	Participants 362 546	METHODS Patients with standard ICD indications undergo defibrillation threshold testing (DFT) at the time of ICD implant, with reconfirmation of lowest successful energy twice (DFT++).
T4	Participants 105 234	BACKGROUND A 10-J energy safety margin has traditionally been used in programming implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).
