T1	Participants 0 119	Efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone: a multicenter clinical trial.
T2	Participants 1370 1620	CONCLUSIONS Breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed bone metastases who were treated with zoledronic acid had a low incidence of SREs compared with patients who received placebo in randomized phase III trials, and pain was decreased from baseline
T3	Participants 1152 1277	The most frequently reported adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were pyrexia (22%) and bone pain (10%)
