T1	Participants 1552 1817	CONCLUSIONS Intravitreal bevacizumab remarkably augmented the short-term response to scatter panretinal laser photocoagulation in high-risk characteristic proliferative diabetic retinopathy but the effect was short-lived, as many of the eyes showed rapid recurrence
T2	Participants 911 999	RESULTS The median age was 52 years (range: 39-68) and 30% of the participants were male
T3	Participants 320 493	METHODS A prospective, fellow-eye sham controlled clinical trial was conducted on 80 eyes of 40 high-risk characteristic proliferative diabetic retinopathy type II diabetics
T4	Participants 136 319	PURPOSE To evaluate the additional therapeutic effect of single intravitreal bevacizumab injection on standard laser treatment in the management of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
T5	Participants 0 134	Bevacizumab-augmented retinal laser photocoagulation in proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a randomized double-masked clinical trial.
