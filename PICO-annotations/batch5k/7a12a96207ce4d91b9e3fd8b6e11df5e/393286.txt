A comparative study of methyldopa and labetalol in the treatment of hypertension.

1 Twenty patients with essential hypertension completed a double-blind, dose-tritrated, cross-over comparison of methyldopa and labetalol. 2 Average lying BPs (systolic/diastolic) were reduced by 28/15 mmHg with methyldopa and by 23/15 mmHg with labetalol. 3 Average standing BPs (systolic/diastolic) were reduced by 29/14 mmHg with methyldopa and by 29/15 mmHg with labetalol. 4 Both lying and standing heart rates were reduced with labetalol. 5 It is concluded that the antihypertensive properties of labetalol and methyldopa are similar but that larger patient populations are needed to study the relative incidence of subjective adverse effects.
