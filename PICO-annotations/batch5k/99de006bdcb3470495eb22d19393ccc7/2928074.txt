Motion aftereffects with horizontally moving sound sources in the free field.

A horizontally moving sound was presented to an observer seated in the center of an anechoic chamber. The sound, either a 500-Hz low-pass noise or a 6300-Hz high-pass noise, repeatedly traversed a semicircular arc in the observer's front hemifield at ear level (distance: 1.5 m). At 10-sec intervals this adaptor was interrupted, and a 750-msec moving probe (a 500-Hz low-pass noise) was presented from a horizontal arc 1.6 m in front of the observer. During a run, the adaptor was presented at a constant velocity (-200 degrees to +200 degrees/sec), while probes with velocities varying from -10 degrees to +10 degrees/sec were presented in a random order. Observers judged the direction of motion (left or right) of each probe. As in the case of stimuli presented over headphones (Grantham & Wightman, 1979), an auditory motion aftereffect (MAE) occurred: subjects responded "left" to probes more often when the adaptor moved right than when it moved left. When the adaptor and probe were spectrally the same, the MAE was greater than when they were from different spectral regions; the magnitude of this difference depended on adaptor speed and was subject-dependent. It is proposed that there are two components underlying the auditory MAE: (1) a generalized bias to respond that probes move in the direction opposite to that of the adaptor, independent of their spectra; and (2) a loss of sensitivity to the velocity of moving sounds after prolonged exposure to moving sounds having the same spectral content.
