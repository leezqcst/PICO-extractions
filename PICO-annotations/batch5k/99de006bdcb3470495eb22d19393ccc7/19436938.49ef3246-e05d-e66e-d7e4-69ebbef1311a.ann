T1	Participants 50 87	older sarcopenic obese New Zealanders
T2	Participants 101 166	Bone, muscle, and fat may affect gait and balance in older adults
T3	Participants 168 268	Osteoporosis was prevalent in low muscle mass participants and related to gait and balance deficits.
T4	Participants 525 557	gait and balance in older adults
T5	Participants 567 757	One hundred eighty-three older adults (age 72.7 +/- 6 years, range 56-93; body mass index 28.2 +/- 4.9, range 16.6-46.0) were recruited from a New Zealand falls prevention intervention trial
T6	Participants 759 1037	Total and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), percent fat, and bone mineralization were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and used to characterize normal lean (NL, n = 51), sarcopenic (SS, n = 18), sarcopenic obese (SO, n = 29), and obese (OO, n = 85) phenotypes
T7	Participants 1615 1629	low ASM groups
