T1	Participants 1475 1750	CONCLUSION One-year-long complementary feeding with FS does not have a significantly larger effect than LP on mean weight gain in all infants, but it is likely to boost linear growth in the most disadvantaged individuals and, hence, decrease the incidence of severe stunting.
T2	Participants 752 913	RESULTS Mean weight and length gains in the LP, FS50, and FS25 groups were 2.37, 2.47, and 2.37 kg (P = .66) and 12.7, 13.5, and 13.2 cm (P = .23), respectively.
T3	Participants 117 332	OBJECTIVE To compare growth and incidence of malnutrition in infants receiving long-term dietary supplementation with ready-to-use fortified spread (FS) or micronutrient-fortified maize-soy flour (likuni phala [LP])
T4	Participants 334 384	DESIGN Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial.
T5	Participants 407 457	PARTICIPANTS A total of 182 six-month-old infants.
