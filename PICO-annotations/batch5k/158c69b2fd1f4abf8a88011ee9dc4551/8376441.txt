A prospective randomised comparison of the dynamic hip screw and the gamma locking nail.

We made a randomised prospective comparison of the Dynamic Hip Screw and the Gamma locking nail for the internal fixation of 200 petrochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. There was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of wound complications in the patients treated by the Gamma nail. They had, however, a high incidence of femoral shaft fracture which we relate in part to implant design. We do not recommend the use of the Gamma nail for these fractures.
