Lactoferrin supplementation to Holstein calves during the preweaning and postweaning phases.

Sixty Holstein calves (30 bulls, 30 heifers) were used to examine the effects of supplemental lactoferrin on feed intake, growth, and health during the preweaning and postweaning periods. One of 3 levels of lactoferrin was supplemented from 3 to 56 d in either whole milk or water to produce 3 dietary treatments: 1) 0 g/d, 2) 0.5 g/d, and 3) 1 g/d. Whole milk (3.8 L/d) containing lactoferrin supplements was fed from bottles until weaning at 35 d. From d 36 to 56, lactoferrin supplements were added to water (15 to 25 mL) and fed from bottles. Lactoferrin supplementation had no effect on feed intake, body weight, average daily gain, heart girth, body temperature, fecal scores, respiratory scores, or haptoglobin concentrations. Calves were housed in individual pens in either an open-sided barn or hutches. Calves raised in the barn consumed more calf starter and therefore grew better than calves raised in hutches. Under the conditions of this study, lactoferrin supplementation was not beneficial. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of lactoferrin, and possible benefits during different feeding conditions or milk sources.
