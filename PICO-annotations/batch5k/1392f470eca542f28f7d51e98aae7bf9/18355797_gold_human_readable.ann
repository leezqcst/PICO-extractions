patients treated with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT)
Participants 405 545 5
A total of 162 diabetic patients with post-amputation wounds (up to the trans-metatarsal level) entered a 16-week, randomized clinical trial
Participants 547 639 4
Patients randomized to V.A.C. (n = 77) received therapy with dressing changes every 48 hours
Participants 641 688 3
Control patients (n = 85) received standard MWT
Participants 808 923 4
RESULTS There was no difference between groups for in-patient hospital stay (number of admissions or length of stay
Participants 1033 1165 4
The average number of dressing changes performed per patient was 118.0 (range 12-226) for MWT versus 41 (6-140) for NPWT (P = .0001)
Participants 1297 1461 5
The average direct cost per patient treated for 8 weeks or longer (independent of clinical outcome) was $27,270 and $36,096 in the NPWT and MWT groups, respectively
