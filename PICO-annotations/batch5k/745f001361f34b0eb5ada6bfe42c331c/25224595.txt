Caphosol(®) mouthwash gives no additional protection against oral mucositis compared to cryotherapy alone in stem cell transplantation. A pilot study.

PURPOSE To investigate if adding Caphosol(®), a mouthwash solution, to oral cryotherapy (OC) further protects against oral mucositis (OM), a toxic painful complication to high dose chemotherapy.
METHOD The study was a randomised, controlled, study design. Patients ≥16 years scheduled for allogeneic stem cell transplantation were included consecutively and randomised to experimental group receiving OC combined with Caphosol(®) (n = 20) or control group receiving OC only (n = 20). OC was given from start to end of HDCT. Caphosol(®), from day 0 to day 21.
RESULT There were no significant differences regarding age or gender between the groups. Mucositis was assessed with the World Health Organisation (WHO) grading scale. Pain was assessed with a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain. Start and duration of therapy with pain relieving drugs, serum C-reactive protein values, and number of days of hospitalisation were collected from the medical records. Data on OM, oral pain, use of i.v. opioids and total parenteral nutrition were collected during 22 days. There was no significant difference between the groups on OM, oral pain, use of i.v. opioids or TPN between the groups.
CONCLUSION The study showed no additional effect of combining Caphosol(®) with OC.
