Impact of antisecretory treatment on respiratory symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children.

The effect of antisecretory treatment on extraesophageal symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease was evaluated. Seventy-eight children presenting with typical and extraesophageal symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease underwent a multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (MII/pH). Children with a positive MII/pH were randomly treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine H(2) -receptor antagonists (H(2) RAs) during 3 months. At the end of the treatment period, all patients were recalled. A second treatment period of 3 months was given to those patients who were not symptom-free after 3 months. Thirty-five of the forty-one (85.4%) children with a pathologic MII/pH presented with extraesophageal symptoms and were treated with PPIs (omeprazole; n:19) or H(2) RAs (ranitidine; n:16) for 12 weeks. After 3 months, 11/19 (57.9%) PPI-treated patients had a complete resolution of symptoms; 6/8 nonresponders were treated with PPI for another 3 months and became all symptom-free. The other two underwent a Nissen fundoplication. Only 5/16 (31.2 %) patients treated with H(2) RAs had a complete resolution of symptoms after 3 months; 1/11 was treated again with H(2) RAs during 3 months, and 10/11 were changed to PPIs. In 3/10, a partial resolution of symptoms was achieved, while in 7/10, a complete remission was obtained (P < 0.05). Antisecretory reflux treatment improves extraesophageal reflux symptoms. The efficacy of PPIs is superior to that of H(2) RAs in these children.
