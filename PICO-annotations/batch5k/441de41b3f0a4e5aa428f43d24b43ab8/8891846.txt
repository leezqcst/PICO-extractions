Levosulpiride in functional dyspepsia: a multicentric, double-blind, controlled trial.

Abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility have been reported in a substantial proportion of patients with functional dyspepsia, supporting the use of prokinetic drugs for treatment of dyspeptic symptoms. To evaluate efficacy and safety of levosulpiride in short-term treatment, 1298 patients were enrolled in a double-blind multicentric study carried out in 45 Italian Gastroenterology Departments. Patients were randomly assigned to either levosulpiride (25 mg tid), domperidone (10 mg tid), metoclopramide (10 mg tid) or placebo (1 tablet tid) for 4 weeks. Patients were selected on the basis of: a) occurrence in the last 4 weeks of at least 5/10 selected symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, postprandial bloating, abdominal fullness, early satiety, belching, heartburn, regurgitation), severity of which should reach/exceed a total score of 8, as assessed by a specific scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe); b) normal results of routine biochemical, ultrasound and endoscopic examinations. In addition, each patient subjectively evaluated efficacy of treatment by a visual analogue scale. Significant improvement was recorded for all symptoms at days 10 and 28 in all groups (p < 0.001), but levosulpiride was significantly (p < 0.01) superior to domperidone, metoclopramide and placebo both in the overall clinical improvement scale as well as in a subgroup of symptoms (postprandial bloating, epigastric pain, heartburn). Active treatments and placebo were comparable as far as concerns occurrence of side-effects (12-20%) including galactorrhoea, breast tenderness and menstrual changes.
