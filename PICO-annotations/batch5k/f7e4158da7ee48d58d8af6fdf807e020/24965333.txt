Vitamin D supplementation ameliorates hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in static magnetic field-exposed rat.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in static magnetic field (SMF)-exposed rats. Rats exposed to SMF (128 mT; 1 h/day) during 5 consecutive days showed an increase in plasma glucose level and a decrease in plasma insulin concentration. By contrast, the same treatment failed to alter body weight and plasmatic total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Interestingly, supplementation with vitamin D (1,600 IU/100 g, per os) corrected and restored glycemia and insulinemia in SMF-exposed rats. The same treatment had no effects on lipid metabolism.
