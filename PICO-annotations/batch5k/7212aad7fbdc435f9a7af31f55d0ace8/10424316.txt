Effects of captopril and enalapril on electroencephalogram and cognitive performance in healthy volunteers.

OBJECTIVE Captopril and enalapril have been reported to influence cognitive functions and quality of life in hypertensive patients.
METHODS The effects of captopril (12.5 mg and 25 mg) and enalapril (5 mg and 10 mg) administered during 7-day periods on electroencephalogram (EEG), cognitive functions, and subjective assessments were investigated in healthy males.
RESULTS Neither captopril nor enalapril influenced EEG and cognitive functions compared with placebo. Captopril 12.5 mg decreased subjective activity compared with placebo. Enalapril did not alter subjective ratings. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower after administration of captopril 25 mg, whereas blood pressure was unaffected by enalapril compared with placebo.
CONCLUSION Our results suggest that central effects of captopril and enalapril were minor and not constant in young healthy men.
