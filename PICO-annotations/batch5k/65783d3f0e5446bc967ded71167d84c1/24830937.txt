Oral magnesium supplementation improves the metabolic profile of metabolically obese, normal-weight individuals: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS We undertook this study to determine the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation in the improvement of the metabolic profile and blood pressure in metabolically obese, normal-weight (MONW) individuals.
METHODS A total of 47 MONW individuals with hypomagnesemia were enrolled in clinical a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Individuals in the intervention group received 30 mL of MgCl2 5% solution (equivalent to 382 mg of magnesium) and individuals in the control group 30 mL of placebo solution, once daily during 4 months. In the absence of obesity or overweight, the presence of fasting glucose levels ≥100 mg/dL, HOMA-IR index ≥3, triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL and/or systolic and diastolic blood pressure ≥140 and 90 mmHg defined the presence of the MONW phenotype. Hypomagnesemia was defined by serum magnesium concentration ≤1.8 mg/dL.
RESULTS At basal conditions there were no significant differences between groups. At the end of follow-up, changes in the mean of systolic (-2.1 vs. 3.9% mmHg, p <0.05) and diastolic (-3.8 vs. 7.5% mmHg, p <0.05) blood pressures, HOMA-IR index (-46.5 vs. -5.4%, p <0.0001), fasting glucose (-12.3 vs. -1.8% mg/dL, p <0.05) and triglyceride levels (-47.4% vs. 10.1% mg/dL, p <0.0001) were significantly lower in the subjects who received MgCl2 compared with individuals in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS Oral magnesium supplementation improves the metabolic profile and blood pressure of MONW individuals.
