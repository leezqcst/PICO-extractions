Buccal misoprostol to decrease blood loss after vaginal delivery: a randomized trial.

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of buccal misoprostol to decrease bleeding after vaginal delivery.
METHODS This was a randomized study of patients between 22 weeks and 42 weeks of gestation with anticipated vaginal delivery. Patients were given either a 200-mug misoprostol tablet or placebo in the buccal space at the time of cord clamping. A continuous dilute intravenous oxytocin infusion was given to all patients at delivery of the placenta. Postpartum hemorrhage was defined as blood loss exceeding 500 mL. Sample size calculations based on previous studies assumed a 13% incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in the control group. To show a statistically significant reduction of postpartum hemorrhage a total of 1,604 patients would be required in each group.
RESULTS A total of 848 patients were enrolled and 756 randomly assigned, 377 in the misoprostol group and 379 in the placebo group. Demographic, antepartum, and intrapartum characteristics were similar between the groups. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, 3% compared with 5%, (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.33-1.29, P = .22), mean estimated blood loss, 322 compared with 329 mL, (P = .45), and mean minutes of the third stage of labor, 6.7 compared with 6.9 (P = .52) were similar between the groups, misoprostol and placebo, respectively. Hemoglobin difference before and after delivery, need for second or third uterotonic agent, and all measured neonatal variables including birth weights, and umbilical cord pH were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION Buccal misoprostol at cord clamping is no more effective than placebo in reducing postpartum hemorrhage.
