Participants 119 289 4
patients with chronic hepatitis C, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are associated with lower rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) to interferon (IFN)-based therapy
Participants 484 589 4
1,046 patients enrolled in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial
Participants 591 704 4
All patients had failed prior treatment with IFN or peginterferon +/- RBV and had Ishak fibrosis scores > or = 3.
Participants 705 1079 3
Four groups of patients with increasingly severe liver disease were compared: (A) bridging fibrosis (Ishak 3 and 4) with platelet counts >125,000/mm3 (n = 559); (B) bridging fibrosis with platelet counts < or =125,000/mm3 (n = 96); (C) cirrhosis (Ishak 5 and 6) with platelet counts >125,000/mm3 (n = 198); and (D) cirrhosis with platelet counts < or =125,000/mm3 (n = 193).
