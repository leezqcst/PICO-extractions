[European topic: liver surgery II--regional chemotherapy].

The most important methods of regional chemotherapy are exemplified by 657 cases of primary and secondary liver only malignancies. I. Adjuvant portal therapy of the liver with resection of the colorectal primary malignancy seems to be advantageous for advanced tumors. II. It is still unresolved whether survival is prolonged by adjuvant treatment of the liver following curative resection of colorectal liver metastases. III. The median survival time (FUDR, pump) is 17 months for palliative local chemotherapy of unresectable colorectal liver metastases. IV. Primary non-resectable liver malignancies show the best results after chemoembolisation (Frankfurt method).
