Lung function measurement in general practice: a comparison of the Escort spirometer with the Micromed turbine spirometer and the mini-Wright peak flow meter.

It is important that new types of spirometer for widespread clinical use are pragmatically evaluated in primary care. This study compared measurements taken by a new portable Fleisch pneumotachograph spirometer (known as the Escort) with those of the commonly used mini-Wright peak flow meter and the Micromed Pocket turbine spirometer. A pragmatic study was conducted in two phases during routine surgeries at Aldermoor Health Centre, Southampton. Phase I compared the new spirometer with the mini-Wright peak flow meter and Phase 2 compared the new spirometer and the turbine spirometer. One hundred patients aged 5-88 years (56 patients with a history of chronic respiratory complaints and 44 patients without) entered Phase 1, and 100 patients aged 6-82 years (62 patients with a history of chronic respiratory complaints and 38 patients without) entered Phase 2. Each patient contributed only once to each phase, but some entered both phases on separate occasions. Ninety-five percent limits of agreement (mean +/- SD) were wide for all comparisons. Graphical plots revealed trends towards higher Escort values as mean values rose compared with both mini-Wright and turbine readings for peak expiratory flow rate and forced expiratory volume in one second. Possible over-reading of peak expiratory flow rate with the mini-Wright meter at low mean values was also seen. Readings taken with these different types of meter cannot be interchanged with confidence in clinical practice. The clinical significance of the theoretically more accurate measures of lung function produced with the new meter, and indeed of spirometry itself, needs further investigation.
