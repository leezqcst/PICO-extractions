Chronopharmacology of enalapril in hypertensive patients.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, are reported to vary with the time of administration. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the effect of enalapril on plasma bradykinin (BK), substance P and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are likely to be involved in the mechanism of enalapril-induced cough, might also be affected by its time of administration. Enalapril 5 mg or placebo was given orally at 10:00 h (day trial) or 22:00 h (night trial) to 12 patients with essential hypertension. Serum concentrations of total drug (enalapril + enalaprilat, its active metabolite) during the day and night trials did not differ significantly at any time. However, serum enalaprilat tended to be higher and its maximum concentration greater in the day trial than in the night trial. Blood pressure 24 h after administration of enalapril was reduced at 22:00 h, but not at 10:00 h. Plasma BK tended to increase following enalapril administration at 10:00 h, but not at 22:00 h. Remarkable increases in plasma BK were observed in two patients in the day trial and one of them also complained of cough. However, no such increase in plasma BK or subsequent adverse effect were recorded in the night trial. Plasma substance P and PGE2 did not change significantly following enalapril administration either in the day or night trial. The results suggest that the response of BK to enalapril is affected by the time of administration. In patients who complain of cough during treatment with enalapril during the daytime, this adverse effect might be diminished or eliminated by a switch to night-time administration.
