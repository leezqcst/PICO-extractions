Effects of topical boswellic acid on photo and age-damaged skin: clinical, biophysical, and echographic evaluations in a double-blind, randomized, split-face study.

Boswellic acids (BAs) are pentacyclic triterpenes with strong anti-inflammatory activity; their most important source is the extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata, a tropical tree that grows in India and Africa. In the present randomized, double-blind, split-face, comparative study we have assessed efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a base cream containing 0.5 % BAs as compared to the same cream without these active ingredients in the treatment of clinical manifestations of photoaging of facial skin. Fifteen female volunteers were enrolled; they applied creams once daily for 30 days. At baseline, at the end of the treatment, and after a 2-month follow-up, clinical findings were assessed according to the Dover classification scale for photoaging and by biophysical and ecographic measurements. We registered a significant improvement of tactile roughness and fine lines in the half side of the face treated with BAs; noninvasive instrumental diagnostic investigations showed an improvement of elasticity, a decrease of sebum excretion, and a change of echographic parameters suggesting a reshaping of dermal tissue. The treatment was always well tolerated without adverse effects. The present findings seem to indicate that the topical application of BAs may represent a suitable treatment option for selected features of skin photoaging.
