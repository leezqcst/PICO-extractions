T1	Participants 19 197	expression of c-erbB-2/neu oncoprotein, epidermal growth factor receptor, cathepsin D, progesterone receptor and tumor associated glycoprotein-72 in different histological types.
T2	Participants 209 226	Gastric carcinoma
T3	Participants 289 311	diffuse and intestinal
T4	Participants 459 485	progesterone receptor (PR)
T5	Participants 398 436	epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR
T6	Participants 370 397	f neu/c-erbB-2 oncoprotein,
T7	Participants 490 531	tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72)
T8	Participants 639 698	85 biopsy samples from patients with gastric adenocarcinoma
T9	Participants 731 771	40 specimens from normal gastric mucosa.
T10	Participants 800 820	determined by ELISA.
T11	Participants 821 939	CatD and TAG-72 were quantified with immunoradiometric (IRMA) methods, and EGFR were studied by radioimmunoassay (RIA)
T12	Participants 1421 1605	The higher PR and catD concentrations in diffuse adenocarcinomas, and the overexpression of TAG-72 in the intestinal type, support the existence of two modes of gastric carcinogenesis.
