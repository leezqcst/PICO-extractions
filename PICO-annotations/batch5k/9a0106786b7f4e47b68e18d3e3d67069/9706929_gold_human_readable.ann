Patients (n = 1066) were randomly allocated to either a volume group (lactated Ringer's solution 15 mL/kg within 15 min before spinal anesthesia), a dihydroergotamine group (10 microg/kg i.m. 15 min before anesthesia), or a placebo group. All patients breathed O2-enriched air during spinal anesthesia (4 mL of plain 0.5% bupivacaine).
