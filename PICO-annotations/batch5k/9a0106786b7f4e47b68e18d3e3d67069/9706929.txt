Incidence and time course of cardiovascular side effects during spinal anesthesia after prophylactic administration of intravenous fluids or vasoconstrictors.

UNLABELLED We studied the time course of arterial hypotension and/or bradycardia requiring treatment during spinal anesthesia and compared the efficacy of i.v. fluid or vasoconstrictor administration for the prevention of these side effects. Patients (n = 1066) were randomly allocated to either a volume group (lactated Ringer's solution 15 mL/kg within 15 min before spinal anesthesia), a dihydroergotamine group (10 microg/kg i.m. 15 min before anesthesia), or a placebo group. All patients breathed O2-enriched air during spinal anesthesia (4 mL of plain 0.5% bupivacaine). With the placebo, there were side effects (mean incidence 22.9%) for up to 45 min after the start of anesthesia. Dihydroergotamine reduced the incidence of side effects, preferentially the late ones, more (mean incidence 11.8%) than fluid administration (mean incidence 16.9%), which was effective only during the first 15 min of anesthesia. Both heart rate and arterial pressure decreased within 15 min before the manifestation of symptoms. In a subgroup of patients, the incidence of side effects (8%) was greatly reduced by the intraoperative application of both sedatives and opioids. We conclude that cardiovascular side effects may occur at any time during spinal anesthesia. Fluid administration reduced the incidence of early events, but dihydroergotamine the late events.
IMPLICATIONS Cardiovascular side effects requiring treatment occurred at any time during spinal anesthesia in our placebo-controlled study, regardless of the prophylactic regimen (fluid infusions versus dihydroergotamine).
