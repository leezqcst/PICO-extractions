[Effects of betamethasone on neuromuscular blockade induced by vecuronium in continuous infusion].

The aim of the study was to determine a possible interaction between a corticosteroid (betamethasone) and vecuronium, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. The authors studied 20 patients, ASA I-II, aged 20-54, both sexes, scheduled for abdominal surgery. Mechanomyographic and clinical evaluation by single twitch and TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist and measurement of the concomitant abductor pollicis muscle was applied. The onset time of vecuronium after a single bolus dose of 0.08 mg/kg, duration of action to 10% single twitch recovery, duration of continuous infusion of 0.4-0.5 micrograms/kg/min of vecuronium started at 10% single twitch recovery, and the effects of 0.1 mg/kg betamethasone administration 10 min after continuous infusion were evaluated. The recovery rate of vecuronium after stopping infusion at 10% recovery was also evaluated. Corticosteroids may interact with non-depolarizing muscle relaxants both in prejunctional and postjunctional acetylcholine receptors by several mechanisms of action.
