Online conductivity monitoring: validation and usefulness in a clinical trial of reduced dialysate conductivity.

Relatively low dialysate conductivity (Cndi) may improve outcomes by reducing the overall sodium burden in dialysis patients. Excess sodium removal, however, could lead to hemodynamic instability. We performed a randomized controlled trial of reduction of Cndi. For the study, 28 patients were randomized to maintenance of Cndi at 13.6 mS/cm (equivalent to 135 mmol/L of Na+) or serial reduction of Cndi in steps of 0.2 mS/cm, guided by symptoms and blood pressure. Sodium removal estimated from pre- and postplasma concentrations correlated well with removal measured by conductivity monitoring as ionic mass balance (R2 0.66, p < 0.0001). Of the 16 patients randomized to reduction of Cndi, 6 achieved Cndi 13.4 mS/cm, 6 achieved 13.2 mS/cm, and 4 achieved 13.0 mS/cm. No episodes of disequilibrium occurred. Interdialytic weight gain was reduced from 2.34 +/- 0.10 kg to 1.57 +/- 0.11 kg (p < 0.0001). Predialysis systolic blood pressure fell from 144 +/- 3 mm Hg to 137 +/- 4 mm Hg (p < 0.05). The reduction in convective sodium removal was balanced by an increase in diffusive sodium removal (95 +/- 9 mmol cf. 175 +/- 14 mmol, p < 0.0001). Reduction in Cndi monitored by IMB is safe and practical and leads to improved interdialytic weight gains and blood pressure control, while avoiding excessive sodium removal.
