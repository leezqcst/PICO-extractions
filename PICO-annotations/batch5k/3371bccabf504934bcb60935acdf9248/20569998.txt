Losartan vs. amlodipine treatment in elderly oncologic hypertensive patients: a randomized clinical trial.

Elderly neoplastic patients frequently may show hypertension and hyperuricemia, before and after chemotherapeutic treatments. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of losartan which is an antihypertensive drug with uricosuric properties vs. amlodipine in hypertensive neoplastic elderly patients. This was an open-labeled, randomized, comparative trial. The study was performed as a 30-day study. Seventy patients with cancer were randomly assigned to receive losartan or amlodipine. Blood pressure (BP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, creatinine, serum and urinary uric acid, creatinine and uric acid clearance were determined before and after chemotherapy. One day after chemotherapy in losartan group vs. amlodipine group we observed a significant difference in urinary uric acid (p<0.001) of 18 mg/24 h vs. 40 mg/24 h. Thirty days after chemotherapy we observed a significant difference in azotemia of 0.0 mg/dl vs. 3.8 mg/dl (p<0.001), serum uric acid of 0.05 mg/dl vs. 0.49 mg/dl (p<0.001), urinary uric acid (p<0.001) of 23 mg/24 h vs. 0.0 mg/24 h, GFR of 2 ml/min/1.73 m(2) vs. -8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (p<0.05) and systolic BP (SBP) of 3.6 mmHg vs. 0.8 mmHg (p<0.05). The findings of the present study support the effective role of losartan compared to amlodipine in treating hypertension and hyperuricemia in elderly patients under chemotherapeutic treatment.
