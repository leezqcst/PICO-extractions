Comparative clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival metronidazole application in adult periodontitis; 12-months results.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival application of 25% metronidazole dental gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of adult periodontitis. Eighty teeth in 18 patients were evaluated using a split mouth design. The test teeth received SRP and a 25% metronidazole gel applied subgingivally on days 0 and 7. The control teeth received SRP only. Clinical and microbiological examinations were carried out before treatment and on weeks 1, 3, 7, 13, 26, 38 and 52 of the experimental period. Colony forming units of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia / Prevotella nigrescens were determined. Both treatments provided significant improvements in all the clinical and microbiological parameters (P<0.05). However, none of the differences between the study groups were statistically significant (P > 0.05). As a conclusion, the present study does not provide evidence in favour of the routine use of adjunctive metronidazole dental gel in the treatment of adult periodontitis.
