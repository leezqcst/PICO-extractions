Efficacy and safety of triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

BACKGROUND In order to accommodate increasing patient preferences a new aqueous formulation of triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray was developed for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.
OBJECTIVE This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray (220 micrograms/day) with placebo in relieving the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis due to ragweed.
METHODS One hundred forty patients received either a once daily 220-microgram dose of triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray or placebo for 2 weeks. Patients evaluated the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms daily for 2 weeks according to a 4-point scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Physician and patient global evaluations of overall treatment effectiveness were assessed at the end of the treatment period.
RESULTS Patients receiving triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray, 220 micrograms/day, had significantly (P < .05) greater improvements in all rhinitis symptoms at weeks 1 and 2 and overall for the 2-week treatment period compared with the placebo group. A significant (P = .006) improvement in the nasal index occurred as early as 12 hours after the first dose of triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray. Both patients and physicians reported a greater overall improvement in symptoms for the triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray group. There were no differences between the two treatment groups in the incidence of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed that a 220-microgram dose of triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray, administered once daily for 2 weeks, is well tolerated and reduces effectively the severity of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis due to ragweed.
