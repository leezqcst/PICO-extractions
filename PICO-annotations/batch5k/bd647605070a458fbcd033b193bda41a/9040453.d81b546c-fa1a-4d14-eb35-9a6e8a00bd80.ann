We explored how in parallel-group trials interindividual variability, correction for placebo effects, and smoothing of blood pressure profiles can be handled in measuring the trough-to-peak ratio in 244 individuals with isolated systolic hypertension (> or = 60 years) enrolled in the placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in europe Trial. Net treatment effects were computed by subtracting the mean changes from baseline during placebo (n = 133) from those during active treatment (n = 111). At entry, systolic/diastolic pressures averaged 176/86 mm Hg in the clinic and 149/80 mm Hg on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. With corrections applied for baseline and placebo, nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/d), reduced (P < .001) these blood pressure values by 16.6/7.3 and 9.8/4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The net trough-to-peak ratios were first determined from blood pressure profiles (12 hours) with 1-hour precision, synchronized by the morning and evening doses of the double-blind medication. According to the usual approach, disregarding interindividual variability, the systolic/diastolic net trough-to-peak ratios were 0.46/0.40 in the morning and 0.77/0.99 in the evening. In individual subjects, the baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were nonnormally distributed. We therefore used a nonparametric technique to calculate the net trough-to-peak ratios from the results in individual subjects
