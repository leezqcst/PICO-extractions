Laser therapy combined with brachytherapy for the palliation of malignant dysphagia.

BACKGROUND/AIM OF STUDY Laser therapy is effective in relieving malignant dysphagia, but repeated treatments at 4 to 6 week intervals are usually required. This prospective randomised trial is designed to determine if addition of brachytherapy offers any advantages over laser therapy alone.
METHODS Patients with inoperable carcinoma of the oesophagus were randomised to receive either endoscopic Nd:YAG laser therapy alone, or laser followed by brachytherapy. Patients who developed worsening dysphagia during follow-up were offered further treatment as appropriate.
RESULTS Fourteen patients were randomised to receive laser only, and 12 to receive laser followed by brachytherapy. Of these 12, one was lost to follow-up and four did not receive brachytherapy because they were unfit, had extension into the cardia or had mainly extrinsic compression. These 4 are included on an 'intention-to-treat' basis. The mean therapeutic interval for the brachytherapy group was significantly longer, 83 days compared to 36 days for the laser group (p = 0.026). There were no differences in the degree of dysphagia relief, number of endoscopic procedures or survival times.
CONCLUSION The preliminary results of this trial suggest that brachytherapy in addition to laser therapy prolongs the first therapeutic interval. However, no long-term advantages have been shown.
