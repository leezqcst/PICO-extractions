T1	Participants 0 96	Oscillatory potentials, retinopathy, and long-term glucose control in insulin-dependent diabetes
T2	Participants 135 264	to assess effects of long-term lowering of glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1%) on neurosensory function in insulin-dependent diabetes
T3	Participants 330 358	oscillatory potentials (OPs)
T4	Participants 415 443	7-years later in 45 patients
T5	Participants 1263 1367	various clinical background variables may influence individual and summed amplitudes of OPs differently.
T6	Participants 1368 1538	Reduced neurosensory retinal function (OPs) seemed to appear after 7-years, independently of vascular defects of retinopathy and long-term improvement in glucose control.
