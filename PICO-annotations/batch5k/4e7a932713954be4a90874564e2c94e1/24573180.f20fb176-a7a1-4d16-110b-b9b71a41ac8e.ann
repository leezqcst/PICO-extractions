T1	Participants 0 90	Activation of the carotid chemoreflex secondary to muscle metaboreflex stimulation in men.
T2	Participants 123 227	carotid chemoreceptor (CC) contributes to sympathetic control of cardiovascular function during exercise
T3	Participants 331 420	As interactions between metaboreceptors and chemoreceptors have been previously observed,
T4	Participants 599 625	Fourteen young healthy men
T5	Participants 795 836	postexercise circulatory occlusion (PECO)
T6	Participants 1483 1687	The ventilatory and MSNA responses to hypoxic PECO were not greater than the sum of the responses to hypoxia and PECO individually, indicating that the CC are not sensitized during metaboreflex activation
T7	Participants 1720 1849	stimulation of the metaboreflex activates, but does not sensitize the CC, and help explain the enhanced CC activity with exercise
