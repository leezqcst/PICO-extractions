T1	Participants 377 529	Eighteen patients received the combination and were compared with six concurrent control and 65 historical control patients treated with rhGM-CSF alone.
T2	Participants 0 129	Use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin in combination after autologous marrow transplantation
T3	Participants 530 738	Patients treated with the combination tended to have more rapid recovery to an absolute neutrophil count of 500 x 10(6)/l (median = 12.5 vs 18 days for concurrent and 19 days for historical control patients).
T4	Participants 749 805	no apparent impact on red cell transfusion requirements,
T5	Participants 856 1027	Patients treated in the current study with rhGM-CSF plus either rHuEPO or with placebo had a higher incidence of rash than seen in our historical experience using rhGM-CSF
T6	Participants 1045 1118	may reflect changes in the source of rhGM-CSF or in the infusion schedule
