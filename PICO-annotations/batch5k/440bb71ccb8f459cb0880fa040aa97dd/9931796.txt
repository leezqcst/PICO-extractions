[Plasma separation combined with CVVHF in septic and SIRS patients].

In a prospective non-randomized trial, 59 patients with sepsis (n = 43) and SIRS (n = 16) were treated on a surgical intensive care unit. In 22 patients plasmapheresis in combination with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) was administered. Lethality was 56% in the sepsis group; in the therapy group lethality was significantly lower in patients with plasmapheresis, even though in this population the organic failure rate was higher. Finally the dependency of lethality and age was similar in both groups. Lethality at 22% in the plasmapheresis group with double organ failure was significantly lower (P > 0.01) than in controls. Reduction of lethality seemed to be as high as 18% in patients with sepsis, while patients with SIRS did not profit from the additional therapy. A prospective randomized trial in sepsis and double organic failure should be projected.
