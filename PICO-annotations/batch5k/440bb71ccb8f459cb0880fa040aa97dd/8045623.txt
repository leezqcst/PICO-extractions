The biological factors in the etiopathogenesis and management of cervical spondylosis.

Two hundred cases of cervical spondylosis were studied for 1 to 4 average (2 1/2) years. No co-relation could be established between the clinical features and the radiological findings in these cases. It was found that parasites play an important role in the multifactorial etiology of this condition and their eradication by deworming drugs gives better results than the traditional therapies. Many new hypotheses are proposed to explain the same.
