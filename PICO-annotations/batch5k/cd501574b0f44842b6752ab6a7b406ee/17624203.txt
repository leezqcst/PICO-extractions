Efficacy and safety of sildenafil in Asian males with erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular risk.

OBJECTIVE Assess the effectiveness of sildenafil in Asian males with erectile dysfunction (ED) and one or more of the co-morbidities, mild-to-moderate hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.
MATERIAL AND METHOD A six-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was carried out in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. One hundred and fifty five male subjects were randomized (2:1) to sildenafil (n = 104) or placebo (n = 51). Sildenafil was started at 50 mg and increased (100 mg) or decreased (25 mg) at week 2 if necessary.
RESULTS On the primary efficacy endpoint, sildenafil-treated subjects had significantly better scores on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questions 3 and 4 than placebo (p < 0.001, both questions). When accumulated into IIEF domains, all five domains were significant in favor of sildenafil. In addition, sildenafil-treated subjects were more satisfied with treatment and had a higher intercourse success rate. The majority of adverse events were mild in severity; the most commonly reported treatment-related events were dizziness (7.7%) and tinnitus (2.9%).
CONCLUSION Sildenafil (25, 50, and 100 mg) was found to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for ED in the present study population of Thai, Malaysian, and Singaporean males who also had increased cardiovascular risk
