T1	Participants 145 167	An observational study
T2	Participants 12 144	blood folate concentrations predict dietary folate intakes in a sample of Canadian lactating women exposed to high levels of folate?
T3	Participants 181 188	In 1998
T4	Participants 292 374	Canada with the intention to increase dietary folate intakes of reproducing women.
T5	Participants 513 537	neural tube defect (NTD)
T6	Participants 661 900	r a folic acid supplement is necessary for NTD prevention among women with high blood folate values, and how reliably high RBC folate concentrations predict folate intakes shown in randomized controlled trials to be protective against NTDs
T7	Participants 1214 1328	determined by weighed food records, were assessed in a sample of predominantly university-educated lactating women
T8	Participants 1396 1528	Median blood folate concentrations of all participants were well above plasma and RBC folate cut-off levels indicative of deficiency
T9	Participants 2201 2381	Folate intakes, estimated by food composition tables, and blood folate concentrations are not predictive of each other in Canadian lactating women exposed to high levels of folate.
T10	Participants 1657 1729	Only modest associations existed between total folate intakes and plasma
T11	Participants 2382 2504	Synthetic intakes > 151-410 microg/d in these women produced little additional benefit in terms of maximizing RBC content.
T12	Participants 2665 2747	a pregnancy should continue to consume a daily folic acid supplement of 400 microg
