Twelve male YEH patients were randomly selected and serum samples were collected for examination before and after 4 weeks of the treatment with QRHT. Twelve healthy males were randomly selected and their serum samples were collected as a control. All serum samples were detected using metabolomic technology with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. Differences in metabolites were studied by principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminate analysis, which produced scores and loadings plots
