Treatment of peri-implantitis by the Vector system.

AIM To compare the effectiveness of treatment of peri-implantitis with a novel ultrasonic device, the Vector system, with that of subgingival debridement with carbon fiber curettes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS The study, comprising 11 patients with at least two screw type implants with bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD) > or =5 mm, and at least 1.5 mm radiographic bone loss and exposed implant threads, was carried out as a single blind randomized clinical trial. At baseline one randomly chosen implant in each patient was treated by the Vector system (test) while the other implant (control) was treated by submucosal debridement with a carbon fiber curette. After 3 months, the same treatments were repeated. Plaque, BOP, and PPD were recorded on all implant surfaces at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months. Bone levels were recorded on radiographs taken prior to the start of the study, and after 6 months.
RESULTS Oral hygiene around both test and control implants was improved at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline. At 6 months, four of the Vector-treated sites, and only one site treated with curettes, had stopped to bleed. In neither the test nor the control group, were there any differences between baseline and 6 months regarding PPD and bone levels.
CONCLUSION Although there was a greater reduction in the number of sites with BOP following treatment with the Vector system than following instrumentation with carbon fiber curettes, there was no significant difference between the two methods.
