Stapled hemorrhoidopexy versus milligan-morgan hemorrhoidectomy: a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial with 2-year postoperative follow up.

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH group) performed using a circular stapler with that of the Milligan-Morgan technique (MM group). The goals of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and reproducibility of stapled hemorrhoidopexy and define its place among conventional techniques.
METHODS A series of 134 patients were included at 7 hospital centers. They were randomized according to a single-masked design and stratified by center (with balancing every 4 patients). Patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 1 year, and a minimum of 2 years after treatment. Patients completed a questionnaire before and 1 year after surgery to evaluate symptoms, function, and overall satisfaction.
RESULTS The mean follow-up period was 2.21 years +/- 0.26 (1.89-3.07). Nine patients (7%) could not be monitored at 1 or 2 years, but 4 of these 9 nevertheless filled in the 1-year questionnaire. The patients in the SH group experienced less postoperative pain/discomfort as scored by pain during bowel movement (P < 0.001), total analgesic requirement over the first 3 days (according to the World Health Organization [WHO] class II analgesics [P = 0.002]; class III [P = 0.066]), and per-patient consumption frequency of class III analgesics (P = 0.089). A clear difference in morphine requirement became evident after 24 hours (P = 0.010). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the SH group (SH 2.2 +/- 1.2 [0; 5.0] versus MM 3.1 +/- 1.7 [1; 8.0] P < 0.001). At 1 year, no differences in the resolution of symptoms were observed between the 2 groups, and over 2 years, the overall incidence of complications was the same, specifically fecaloma (P = 0.003) in the MM group and external hemorrhoidal thrombosis (P = 0.006) in the SH group. Impaired sphincter function was observed at 1 year with no significant difference between the groups for urgency (12%), continence problems (10%), or tenesmus (3%). No patient needed a second procedure for recurrence within 2 years, although partial residual prolapse was detected in 4 SH patients (7.5%) versus 1 MM patient (1.8%) (P = 0.194).
CONCLUSION Stapled hemorrhoidopexy causes significantly less postoperative pain. The technique is reproducible and can achieve comparable outcomes as those of the MM technique as long as the well-described steps of the technique are followed. Like with conventional surgery, anorectal dysfunction can occur after stapled hemorrhoidopexy in some patients. Its effectiveness in relieving symptoms is equivalent to conventional surgery, and the number of hemorrhoidal prolapse recurrences at 2 years is not significantly different. Hemorroidopexy is applicable for treating reducible hemorrhoidal prolapse.
