T1	Participants 937 1113	CONCLUSION Single-dose rabeprazole 20 mg was as effective as esomeprazole 40 mg in increasing intragastric pH and maintaining pH>3 and >4, despite the 2-fold difference in dose
T2	Participants 497 656	RESULTS Mean intragastric pH was higher after esomeprazole than rabeprazole during 0-5 h after dosing (P=0.0001); the reverse was true from 14-24 h (P=0.0002).
T3	Participants 206 276	METHODS Open, randomised, 2-way crossover, clinical pharmacology study
T4	Participants 114 204	OBJECTIVE To compare antisecretory effects of single doses of rabeprazole and esomeprazole
