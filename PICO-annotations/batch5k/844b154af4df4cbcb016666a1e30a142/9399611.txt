Evaluation of hypertensive patients after care provided by community pharmacists in a rural setting.

We evaluated blood pressure control, quality of life, quality of care, and satisfaction of patients who were monitored by specially trained community pharmacists in a group medical practice. After participating in an intensive skill development program, pharmacists performed in an interdisciplinary team in a rural clinic. The primary objective was assessed by evaluating outcome variables at 6 months compared with baseline in 25 patients randomly assigned to a study group. A control group of 26 patients was also evaluated to determine if outcome variables remained constant from baseline to 6 months. Systolic blood pressure was reduced in the study group (151 mm Hg baseline, 140 mm Hg at 6 mo, p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower at 2, 4, and 5 months compared with baseline. Ratings from a blinded peer review panel indicated significant improvement in the appropriateness of the blood pressure regimen, going from 8.7 +/- 4.7 to 10.9 +/- 4.5 in the study group (p<0.01), but they did not change in the control group. Several quality of life scores improved significantly in the study group after 6 months (p<0.05). These included physical functioning (61.6 vs 70.7), physical role limitations (56.8 vs 72.8), and bodily pain (60.0 vs 71.7) at baseline and 6 months, respectively. There were no significant changes in the control group. Patient satisfaction scores were consistently higher in the study group at the end of the study. Our results indicate that when community pharmacists in a clinic setting are trained and included as members of the primary care team, significant improvements in blood pressure control, quality of life, and patient satisfaction can be achieved.
