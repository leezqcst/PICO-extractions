We assessed treatment effect on LS BMD in different patient subgroups at month 12 that contributed to the risk of osteoporosis in addition to glucocorticoids. Methods Patients randomized to a single IV infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg or risedronate (5 mg/day) and stratified based on glucocorticoids duration [treatment (>3 months) and prevention (â‰¤ 3 months) subpopulations]were subgrouped by age; gender; menopausal status in women; dose and duration of prednisone during the trial; and baseline serum 25-OH vitamin D, LS BMD T-score, creatinine clearance, and concomitant medication us
