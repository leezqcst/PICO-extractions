Multimodal evaluation of risperidone for destructive behavior: functional analysis, direct observations, rating scales, and psychiatric impressions.

Risperidone, an atypical neuroleptic, has become a popular option for treating destructive behaviors of persons with developmental disabilities. A few studies have been conducted that evaluate the effects of risperidone on destructive behavior; however, none of these studies have combined objective measures with rating scales to evaluate the effects of risperidone on destructive behavior across home and clinical settings. This study evaluated the wide range of effects of risperidone on destructive behavior of 2 persons with developmental disabilities using weekly functional analysis sessions, daily observations, hourly home data, weekly rating scales, and monthly psychiatric impressions. Results indicate that risperidone does decrease destructive behavior and that, for the most part, all of the various measures yielded similar results.
