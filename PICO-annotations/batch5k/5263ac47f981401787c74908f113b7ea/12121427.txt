Walking trials in postmenopausal women: effect of one vs two daily bouts on aerobic fitness.

We compared the effects of one vs two daily bouts of walking on aerobic fitness and body composition in postmenopausal women. One hundred and thirty-four subjects were randomized into exercise groups or a control group and 130 completed the study. The subjects walked 5 d/week for 15 weeks at 65% of their maximal aerobic power expending 300 kcal (1255 kJ) in exercise in one (Group S1) or two daily sessions (Group S2). VO(2max) was measured in a direct maximal treadmill test. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and the percentage of body fat (fat%) estimated using skinfold measurements. The net change in the VO(2max) was 2.5 mL min/kg (95% CI 1.5, 3.5) (8.7%) in Group S1 and 2.5 mL min/kg (95% CI 1.5, 3.5) (8.8%) in Group S2. The net change in body mass was -1.2 kg (95% CI-1.9, -0.5) in Group S1 and -1.1 kg (95% CI -1.8, -0.4) in Group S2. The net fat% change was -2.1% (95% CI-2.7, -1.4) in Group S1 and -1.7% (95% CI-2.3, -1.0) in Group S2. Exercise improved the maximal aerobic power and body composition equally when walking was performed in one or two daily bouts.
