A double-blind comparative study of ofloxacin otic drops versus neomycin-polymyxin B-hydrocortisone otic drops in the medical treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media.

Active chronic suppurative otitis media poses a management problem when patients are being considered for surgical treatment. Topical antibiotics have demonstrated varying degrees of success in the management of discharging ears. The introduction of quinolones has revived interest in these topical agents. This double-blind study compares two antibiotics, namely ofloxacin and neomycin-polymyxin B, with similar in vitro sensitivities to Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. Fifty-two patients were selected randomly and the results show that ofloxacin eardrops have marginal benefits in symptomatic improvement (89 per cent versus 79 per cent, p = 0.27) and bacterial eradication (81 per cent versus 75 per cent, p = 0.81) in active chronic suppurative otitis media. Significantly fewer patients (seven per cent versus 29 per cent, p = 0.04) in the ofloxacin group had active disease at the end of the two-week treatment. We recommend the use of ofloxacin eardrops in managing active chronic suppurative otitis media since it has high clinical efficacy, contains no steroid component and has no demonstrated risk of ototoxicity.
