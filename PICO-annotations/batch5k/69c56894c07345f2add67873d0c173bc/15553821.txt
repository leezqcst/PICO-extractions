[Study on treatment of iron-deficiency anemia by shengxuening].

OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effect of shengxuening (SXN) in treating iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and to explore its molecular mechanism on iron metabolism balance regulation.
METHODS Patients with IDA were randomly divided into the treated group and the control group, 50 in each group. They were treated with SXN (0.1 g, three times per day) and ferrous gluconate (0.1 g, three times per day) respectively, for 30 days. Levels of serum iron (Fe), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin (SF), transferrin (Tf), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and blood routine test, as well as scoring of TCM qi-blood deficiency Syndrome were conducted before and after treatment.
RESULTS The total effective rate in the treated group reached 92%, it was shown that SXN could improve the iron metabolism, increase levels of Fe, TS, SF and reduce levels of TIBC, Tf, sTfR, it has obvious effect in promoting erythrocyte generation and could promote formation of leucocytes and platelets. The total effective rate in the control group was 32%, which was significantly lower than that in the treated group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION The effect of SXN in treating IDA and qi-blood deficiency Syndrome is evident, it could improve the iron metabolism, increase levels of Fe, TS, SF and lower levels of TIBC, Tf, sTfR.
