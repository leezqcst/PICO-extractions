T1	Participants 482 575	Thirty nonbleeding patients with international normalized ratios (INRs) ranging from 6.0-10.0
T2	Participants 591 686	Patients were randomized to receive either a single oral dose of phytonadione 2.5 mg or placebo
T3	Participants 1008 1039	patients receiving phytonadione
T4	Participants 1515 1558	asymptomatic patients with INRs of 6.0-10.0
T5	Participants 1606 1758	patients at high risk for bleeding in whom the benefit of prompt INR reduction would outweigh the thromboembolic risk associated with INR overcorrection
