T1	Participants 67 94	dependent amphetamine users
T2	Participants 218 245	dependent amphetamine users
T3	Participants 561 782	Amphetamine users (n = 19) were divided into two groups, high dependence (n = 10) and low dependence (n = 10), based on amphetamine Severity of Dependence Scale scores, and compared to an age-matched control group (n = 9)
T4	Participants 792 946	The high-dependence group showed slowed reaction time and reduced early processing negativity and peak N1 amplitude to location-relevant nontarget stimuli
T5	Participants 1170 1194	severely dependent users
