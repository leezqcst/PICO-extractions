Intravitreal ranibizumab versus isovolemic hemodilution in the treatment of macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion: twelve-month results of a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial.
Participants 206 533 4
PURPOSE This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, investigator-initiated trial to evaluate the 12-month effectiveness of isovolemic hemodilution (IH) with prompt versus deferred intravitreal injections (IVI) of ranibizumab 0.5 mg for the treatment of macular edema secondary to early central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)
Participants 535 738 5
METHODS Eyes with macular edema due to CRVO having occurred not more than 8 weeks previously received either monthly ranibizumab IVI in combination with IH (group I, n = 28) or IH alone (group II, n = 30
Participants 990 1125 3
RESULTS At 12 months, eyes in group I on average gained +28.1 (±19.3) letters compared to +25.2 (±20.9) letters in group II (p = 0.32
