T1	Participants 1684 1911	CONCLUSIONS Although the patients in the levosimendan group were alive for more days and thus at risk of hospitalisation for longer, there was no increase in hospitalisation or hospitalisation costs with levosimendan treatment.
T2	Participants 1122 1257	RESULTS The mean survival over 6 months was 157+/-52 days in the levosimendan group and 139+/-64 days in the dobutamine group (P<0.01).
T3	Participants 529 729	METHODS This economic evaluation was based on a European clinical trial (LIDO), in which 203 patients with severe heart failure randomly received a 24 h infusion with either levosimendan or dobutamine
T4	Participants 166 369	BACKGROUND Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitiser, improves cardiac performance and symptoms without increasing oxygen consumption, and decreases the mortality of patients with low-output heart failure
T5	Participants 0 164	Intravenous levosimendan treatment is cost-effective compared with dobutamine in severe low-output heart failure: an analysis based on the international LIDO trial.
