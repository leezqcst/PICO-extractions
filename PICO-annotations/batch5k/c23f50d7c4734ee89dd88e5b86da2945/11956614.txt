Endometrial cytodiagnosis using a new softcyte versus a conventional endocyte.

A new endometrial cytologic sampling device, softcyte, was used in cytological screening for endometrial cancer, and was compared with the endocyte with regard to manipulability, adverse effects (including pain and hemorrhage), and cellular findings (including the quantity of cells collected, the success rate, cell freshness, and cellular clumping). A total of 315 women (premenopause 251, postmenopause 64) were randomly assigned to two groups who underwent the endometrial cytological screening with either the softcyte or the endocyte. To assess the value of the softcyte we compared it with the endocyte. Endometrial cytology using a softcyte or an endocyte achieved high correct diagnosis rate for cancer, and both instruments are valuable as endometrial cytologic sample devices. The softcyte causes only mild pain on introduction and during collection, and a large quantity of cells could be harvested. These results suggest that the softcyte is a useful cytologic sampling device in screening for endometrial cancer.
