Comparison of the efficacy and safety of esmolol, a short-acting beta blocker, with placebo in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The Esmolol vs Placebo Multicenter Study Group.

The efficacy and safety of esmolol, a short-acting intravenous beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, and placebo were compared in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (heart rate greater than 120 bpm) in a multicenter, double-blind, partial-crossover study. Seventy-one patients were randomized to receive either esmolol (n = 36) or placebo (n = 35) as initial treatment. Therapeutic failures were crossed over to the other study medication. Therapeutic response was defined as greater than or equal to 20% reduction in heart rate, heart rate less than 100 bpm, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm. The therapeutic response to esmolol during the initial treatment period (72%) was similar to that obtained when esmolol was given as a second agent. The average esmolol dosage producing a therapeutic response was 97.5 micrograms/kg/min. Four patients (6%) converted to normal sinus rhythm during esmolol infusion. In the majority of patients (80%), therapeutic response was lost within 30 minutes following discontinuation of esmolol infusion, a finding indicative of rapid reversal of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The most prevalent adverse effect during esmolol infusion was hypotension which occurred in eight patients (12%). Hypotension and associated symptoms resolved within 30 minutes after discontinuation of esmolol infusion, which is consistent with the short duration of action of esmolol (elimination half-life of 9.2 minutes).
