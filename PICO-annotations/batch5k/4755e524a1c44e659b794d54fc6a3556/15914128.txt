Effects of two combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol 20 microg combined with either drospirenone or desogestrel on lipids, hemostatic parameters and carbohydrate metabolism.

OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of ethinyl estradiol 20 microg/drospirenone 3 mg (EE 20 microg/DRSP 3 mg) administered according to a 24/4 regimen with ethinyl estradiol 20 microg/desogestrel 150 microg (EE 20 microg/DSG 150 microg) administered according to the conventional 21/7 regimen on lipid, carbohydrate and hemostatic parameters.
STUDY DESIGN In this open-label study, healthy women were randomized to EE 20 microg/DRSP 3 mg or EE 20 microg/DSG 150 microg for seven cycles. Mean differences in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels at cycle 7 compared to baseline were assessed. Secondary variables included changes in other lipid, hemostatic and carbohydrate parameters.
RESULTS Both treatments increased HDL-cholesterol, but decreased LDL-cholesterol by a comparable extent. Although slightly elevated in both groups, blood glucose and C-peptide levels measured during oral glucose tolerance tests were within normal reference ranges at cycle 7. Overall, the differences in lipid, hemostatic or carbohydrate parameters were not significant between the two treatments.
CONCLUSION EE 20 microg/DRSP 3 mg has a good safety profile comparable with EE 20 microg/DSG 150 microg.
