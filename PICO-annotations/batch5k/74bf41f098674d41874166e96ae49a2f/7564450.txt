Hemostatic function of aspirin-treated platelets vulnerable to cardiopulmonary bypass. Altered shear-induced pathway.

The impaired hemostasis of aspirin-treated patients is an annoying problem during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. The hemostatic function of platelets comprises two mechanisms: the shear-induced and the cyclooxygenase pathways. Because the latter is inhibited in aspirin-treated patients, the hemostatic function depends mainly on the former pathway. To investigate the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on the shear-induced pathway, a double-blind study of preoperative aspirin treatment (325 mg) and placebo was conducted in 40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Postoperative blood loss was higher in the aspirin-treated patients than in the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.05). The shear-induced hemostasis was monitored by the in vitro bleeding test (Thrombostat), which mimics bleeding through an injured arteriole. The shear-induced pathway of aspirin-treated platelets was not affected before cardiopulmonary bypass, but it was impaired more during the operation (p < 0.01) and remained worse afterward (p < 0.05), compared with that of placebo-treated platelets. The inhibitory effects of aspirin on thromboxane production and on collagen-induced platelet aggregation remained throughout the operation. In aspirin-treated platelets, the aggregation capacity induced by adenosine diphosphate was inhibited before the operation (p < 0.05) and showed substantial recovery during the operation (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the shear-induced pathway of aspirin-treated platelets is more vulnerable to cardiopulmonary bypass than the pathway in normal platelets and causes severe impairment of hemostasis afterward.
