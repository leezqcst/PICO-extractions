T1	Participants 472 701	To investigate the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on the shear-induced pathway, a double-blind study of preoperative aspirin treatment (325 mg) and placebo was conducted in 40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting
T2	Participants 1549 1766	These results suggest that the shear-induced pathway of aspirin-treated platelets is more vulnerable to cardiopulmonary bypass than the pathway in normal platelets and causes severe impairment of hemostasis afterward.
T3	Participants 0 86	Hemostatic function of aspirin-treated platelets vulnerable to cardiopulmonary bypass.
