Effect of antacids on intragastric pH in healthy subjects and duodenal ulcer patients. Influence of the size of the antacid dose and of anticholinergics.

Different doses of two liquid antacids, alone and combined with an anticholinergic agent, were studied with respect to the duration of antacid action. The studies were performed in healthy subjects with MAO less than 30 mmol/h and in duodenal ulcer patients with MAO greater than 35 mmol/h. Gastric pH was recorded using radiotelemetric technique (Heidelberg capsule). In the healthy subjects, there was no significant difference in the duration of action with the different doses but in duodenal ulcer patients a tenfold increase of the antacid dose resulted in a doubling of the duration of action. Combined treatment with an anticholinergic and antacids enhanced the antacid effects in both groups. It is concluded that an antacid dose should be so great that it binds secreted acid before the dose leaves the stomach. Further increase of the dose will not increase the duration. Concomitant use of an anticholinergic agent increases the duration of antacid action.
