psychological distress on cardiac prognosis in patients participating in a psychosocial intervention program
Participants 151 513 6
OBJECTIVE The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the relationships between a reduction in psychological distress and long-term cardiac and psychological outcomes in post-myocardial infarction patients who participated in a randomized trial of home-based psychosocial nursing interventions (the Montreal Heart Attack Readjustment Trial [M-HART]).
Participants 550 765 8
METHODS We studied 433 patients (36.0% women) from the M-HART treatment group who received two home visits after achieving a high psychological distress score (ie, > or =5) on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).
Participants 1530 1623 3
Results held for men and women and were not altered by controlling for potential confounders.
Participants 1700 1885 3
CONCLUSIONS Post-myocardial infarction interventions that reduce psychological distress have the potential to improve long-term prognosis and psychological status for both men and women
