[Randomized control study of high-dose metoclopramide in the prevention of CDDP-induced emesis].

The effect of high-dose metoclopramide (2 mg/kg, 4 times every 2 hours) on the emesis of patients treated with CDDP (80 mg/m2) was examined by randomized control trial. The above metoclopramide regimen significantly suppressed the frequency of vomiting on the day of CDDP administration. The duration of nausea and anorexia after CDDP treatment was also shortened by high-dose metoclopramide administration.
