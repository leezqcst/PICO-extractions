Clinical efficacy of fluvoxamine and functional polymorphism in a serotonin transporter gene on childhood autism.

We studied the correlation between response to fluvoxamine and serotonin transporter gene promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Eighteen children with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study of fluvoxamine. Behavioral assessments were obtained before and at 12 weeks of treatment. 5-HTTLPR (long (l) or short(s)), was analyzed by the PCR method. Ten out of 18 patients responded to fluvoxamine treatment; allele type analysis revealed that clinical global effectiveness was noted significantly more in the l allele than in the s allele. However, with respect to language use, a significant effectiveness was noted in the s allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence the individual responses to fluvoxamine administration.
