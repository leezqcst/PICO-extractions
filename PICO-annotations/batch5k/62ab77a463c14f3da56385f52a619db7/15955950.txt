TENS for the treatment of writer's cramp dystonia: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Manipulation of afferent inputs may temporarily modulate dystonic spasms. Ten patients with writer's cramp were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in which the effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and placebo treatment were compared. Patients were evaluated using four measures of dystonic impairment. The TENS group showed a significant improvement that persisted for 3 weeks in three of the four measures.
