Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy after radiation therapy in stage I low-grade and intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Results of a prospective randomized study.

BACKGROUND In a prospective randomized manner, this study evaluated the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; CHOP) in patients with Stage I non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who have achieved a complete response (CR) after radiation therapy (RT).
METHODS Forty-four patients with clinical or pathologic Stage I intermediate-grade or low-grade NHL were randomized to receive regional RT alone (median dose, 40 Gy) or regional RT followed by six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy. There were no differences in clinical and pathologic characteristics between the two treatment groups.
RESULTS The median follow-up was 7 years (range, 2-10 years). The actuarial relapse-free survival (RFS) rate for the RT plus CHOP group at 7 years was 83% compared with 47% (P < 0.03) for the RT-alone group. The overall survival (OS) for the two groups was 88% and 66%, respectively (P = 0.2). In patients with intermediate-grade NHL, the 7-year actuarial RFS for RT and CHOP was 86% compared with 20% for RT alone (P = 0.004). The corresponding actuarial survival rates were 92% and 47%, respectively (P = 0.08). In patients with low-grade histologic findings, the addition of adjuvant CHOP did not improve RFS (P = 0.6) or OS. All relapses in this study were at sites remote from the initially involved areas, and in 5 of 11 patients (45%), there were recurrences 5 years or longer after initial treatment.
CONCLUSIONS This study showed that adjuvant CHOP chemotherapy significantly improves RFS in patients with Stage I intermediate-grade NHL who achieve a CR after regional-field RT. The chemotherapeutic regimen favorably affected their probability of survival.
