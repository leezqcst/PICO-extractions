T1	Participants 1147 1552	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS During CPAP withdrawal, severe sleep-disordered breathing was evident and administration of modafinil improved simulated driving performance (steering variability, P < 0.0001; mean reaction time, P <or= 0.0002; lapses, P <or= 0.01 on a concurrent task), psychomotor vigilance task (mean 1/reaction time and lapses, both P <or= 0.0002), and subjective sleepiness (P <or= 0.01)
T2	Participants 400 499	OBJECTIVES We hypothesized that the wakefulness promoter, modafinil, would ameliorate this decline.
T3	Participants 1554 1744	CONCLUSIONS Modafinil prevented the decline in simulated driving performance, neurocognitive performance, and subjective sleepiness in patients with OSA with acutely interrupted CPAP therapy
