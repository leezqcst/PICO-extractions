T1	Participants 1394 1582	In conclusion, online HDF in sepsis-related AKI could provide significantly better removal of VEGF and other cytokines and these were associated with better renal outcome than high-flux HD
T2	Participants 803 895	The percentages of the reduction ratio in plasma cytokines were measured as primary outcomes
T3	Participants 0 182	Enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor and inflammatory cytokine removal with online hemodiafiltration over high-flux hemodialysis in sepsis-related acute kidney injury patients
