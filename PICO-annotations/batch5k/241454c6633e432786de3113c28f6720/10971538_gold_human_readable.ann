treatment of snoring

Patients who had been referred for investigation and treatment of their snoring were randomly allocated to receive either UPPP or LAUP. Forty-seven patients with confirmed palatal flutter had surgery and all of them had a preoperative and postoperative objective assessment of their snoring loudness and duration in the home. The recording device (Snore Box) is simple for the patient to operate, portable with a built in microphone, and able to produce objective results, which can be automatically analysed.
