[Obstetrical analgesia with tramadol].

Parenteral analgesia with Tramal was performed in 23 normal deliveries. The results were compared with a group of normal deliveries in which analgesia was achieved with pethidine. Both medicaments excerted an identical analgetic efficiency. No adverse side effects were observed with Tramal concerning the follow-up of labour or the newborn. Tramal can be recommended for obstetrical analgesia since it does not excert inhibitory effects upon the respiratory center.
