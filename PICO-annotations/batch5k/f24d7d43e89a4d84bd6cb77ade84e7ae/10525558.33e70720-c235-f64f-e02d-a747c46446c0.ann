T1	Participants 2115 2406	CONCLUSIONS Since this analysis of reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change did not clearly favour one instrument above the other, the choice between the CRQ and the SGRQ can be based on other considerations such as the required sample size or the availability of reference values
T2	Participants 880 1007	RESULTS The proportions of missing values per patient were low for both questionnaires (0.54% for the CRQ and 2% for the SGRQ).
T3	Participants 603 804	METHODS One hundred and forty four patients with moderate or severe COPD were randomly assigned to receive three months of treatment with either salmeterol, salmeterol + ipratropium bromide, or placebo
