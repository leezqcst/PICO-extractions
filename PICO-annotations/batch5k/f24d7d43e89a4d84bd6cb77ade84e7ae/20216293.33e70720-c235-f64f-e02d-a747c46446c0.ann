T1	Participants 1612 1729	CONCLUSION Pattern scan laser showed lesser collateral damage and similar regression of retinopathy compared with GLX
T2	Participants 974 1074	RESULTS Pattern scan laser and GLX required an average fluence of 40.33 vs 191 J/cm(2), respectively
T3	Participants 444 506	METHODS This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial
T4	Participants 128 443	PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy, collateral damage, and convenience of panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy using a 532-nm solid-state green laser (GLX) versus a multispot 532-nm pattern scan laser (PASCAL).
