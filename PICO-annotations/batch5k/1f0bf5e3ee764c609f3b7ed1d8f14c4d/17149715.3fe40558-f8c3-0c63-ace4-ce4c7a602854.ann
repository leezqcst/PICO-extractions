T1	Participants 541 725	Patients were evaluated by accelerometry and the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) rating scale at baseline and days 14 and 28, as well as the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-C) scale at day 28.
T2	Participants 363 457	Twenty patients (mean age, 60 +/- 15 years) with ET were randomized to receive ZNS or placebo.
T3	Participants 726 810	At endpoint, subjects assigned to ZNS were taking a mean dosage of 160 +/- 50 mg/day
T4	Participants 894 979	Tremor amplitude as assessed by accelerometry significantly improved in the ZNS group
T5	Participants 1110 1264	60% (n = 6) of patients in the ZNS group felt that their tremor was unchanged, while the remaining patients felt that their tremor was "minimally improved
T6	Participants 1264 1417	." Thirty percent (n = 3) of patients taking ZNS discontinued the study due to side effects (fatigue, headache, paresthesias) while taking 100 mg per day
