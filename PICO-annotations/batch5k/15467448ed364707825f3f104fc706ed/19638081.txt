Efficacy of prepackaged, low residual test meals with 4L polyethylene glycol versus a clear liquid diet with 4L polyethylene glycol bowel preparation: a randomized trial.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS A prepackaged low residue one-day diet (breakfast, lunch and dinner) has been recently developed to improve patient tolerance for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of bowel preparation protocols based on a low residue diet and 4L polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, and to compare these new options with the traditional liquid diet and the PEG 4L lavage.
METHODS A total of 214 patients (mean age: 54.1 years; 120 male, 94 female) from four university hospitals were included in the analysis. Patients were randomized to receive a clear liquid diet and the PEG 4L regimen (106 patients) or the low residue test meals and the PEG 4L regimen (TM-PEG 4L, 108 patients). The colon cleansing efficacy of the different preparations was rated using the Ottawa bowel preparation scale.
RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the treatment groups according to the Ottawa cleansing scale findings (PEG 4L: 2.97 vs TM-PEG 4L: 2.46, P = 0.063). The overall tolerability was higher in the TM-PEG 4L group than in the PEG 4L group (P = 0.036). No difference was found when the two groups were compared with regard to adverse events (P = 0.599).
CONCLUSIONS A prepackaged low residue one-day diet provided cleansing efficacy similar to that of a clear liquid diet and offered the benefit of improved tolerability compared to the conventional PEG 4L regimen.
