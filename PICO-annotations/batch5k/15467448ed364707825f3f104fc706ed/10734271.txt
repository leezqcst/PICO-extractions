Computer-assisted instruction: an effective instructional method for HIV prevention education?

PURPOSE To compare the effectiveness of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI)-based intervention to a more traditional lecture-based intervention for influencing psychosocial correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preventive behaviors.
METHODS Students enrolled in a Human Sexuality course (N = 152) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CAI, Lecture, or No Intervention group. Participants in the CAI group reviewed a 1-hour long CAI program, participants in the Lecture group were presented with a 1-hour long lecture, and participants in the No Intervention group received no intervention. After completing the respective interventions, all participants completed the HIV questionnaire, which measured selected Social Cognitive Theory constructs associated with HIV preventive behaviors. MANCOVA, ANCOVA and Post Hoc analyses were utilized to test for significant differences among the three groups.
RESULTS The analyses disclosed that, compared to participants in the Lecture group, participants in the CAI group scored significantly higher on the scales measuring autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) knowledge, self-evaluative outcome motivation, and intention to practice HIV preventive behaviors with current partner. In addition, compared to the No Intervention group, the CAI group scored significantly higher on the scales measuring physical outcome motivation and social outcome motivation.
CONCLUSIONS CAI-based programs can be effective for delivering instruction on HIV prevention. However, because of certain limitations, this type of program is best utilized as part of a more comprehensive intervention that uses several different delivery systems.
