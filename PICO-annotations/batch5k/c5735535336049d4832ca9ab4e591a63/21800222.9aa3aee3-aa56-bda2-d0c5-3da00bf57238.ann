T1	Participants 1647 1808	CONCLUSIONS In obese OSA patients changing from a nasal to oronasal mask increased leak and residual AHI but did not affect the therapeutic pressure requirement.
T2	Participants 1020 1148	RESULTS Twelve patients completed the trial (mean ± SD AHI 59.8 ± 28.6 events/h; CPAP 11.1 ± 3.2 cmH(2)O; BMI 37.7 ± 5.0 kg/m(2)
T3	Participants 524 864	METHODS Patients with severe OSA currently using CPAP at ≥4 h/night with a nasal mask were examined (including Mallampati scale, incisal relationship, and mandibular protrusion) and then randomized to receive auto-positive airway pressure (PAP) or fixed CPAP at a manually titrated pressure for 1 week each at home, with immediate crossover
T4	Participants 169 522	PURPOSE This single-blinded, randomized, controlled pilot study aimed to investigate whether there is a difference between nasal and oronasal masks in therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) requirement, residual disease, or leak when treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and if differences were related to measures of upper airway size
