[Effects of small needle-knife comprehensive therapy on pain and lumbar flexion range in the chronic nonspecific low back pain patient].

OBJECTIVE To observe therapeutic effect of small needle-knife comprehensive therapy on pain and lumbar flexion range in the chronic nonspecific low back pain patient.
METHODS Three hundred and five cases were randomly divided into a needle-knife group of 153 cases and a physiotherapy group of 152 cases. The needle-knife group were treated with small needle-knife releasing therapy, blocking and functional training. The physiotherapy group were treated with ultra-short wave, modulated medium frequency current, massage and functional training. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and the lumbar flexion range was determined before and after treatment.
RESULTS After treatment, the pain and the lumbar flexion range were significantly improved in the two groups; and after treatment, the VAS score and the lumbar flexion range were (1.60 +/- 0.38) points and (65.76 +/- 15.11) cm in the needle-knife group and (4.59 +/- 1.09) points and (53.74 +/- 15.13) cm in the physiotherapy group, respectively, the needle-knife group being significantly better than the physiotherapy group (P < 0.01). Follow-up survey of 6-36 months showed that the VAS score and the lumbar flexion range in the needle-knife group were superior to those in the physiotherapy group.
CONCLUSION Small needle-knife comprehensive therapy can significantly improve pain and lumbar flexion range in the chronic nonspecific low back pain patient, with a stable long-term therapeutic effect.
