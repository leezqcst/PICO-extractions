Trimetazidine: a new concept in the treatment of angina. Comparison with propranolol in patients with stable angina. Trimetazidine European Multicenter Study Group.

1. Trimetazidine has a direct anti-ischaemic effect on the myocardium without altering the rate x pressure product or coronary blood flow. 2. The effects of trimetazidine (20 mg three times daily) were compared with those of propranolol (40 mg three times daily) in a double-blind parallel group multicentre study in 149 men with stable angina. 3. Reproducibility of exercise performance was verified during a 3 week run-in placebo washout period. All patients had > 1 mm ST-depression on exercise test. 4. After 3 months, similar anti-anginal efficacy was observed between the trimetazidine (n = 71) and propranolol (n = 78) groups. No significant differences were observed between trimetazidine and propranolol as regards anginal attack rate per week (mean difference P-TMZ: 2; 95% CI: -4.4, 0.5) and exercise duration (mean difference P-TMZ: 0 s; 95% CI: -33, 34) or time to 1 mm ST segment depression (mean difference P-TMZ: 13 s; 95% CI: -24, 51). Heart rate and rate x pressure product at rest and at peak exercise remained unchanged in the trimetazidine group but significantly decreased with propranolol (P < 0.001 in all cases). With both drugs there was a trend to decreased ischaemic episodes in the 46% patients who experienced ambulatory ischaemia on Holter monitoring. Six patients stopped trimetazidine and 12 propranolol. Of these, five in each group were withdrawn because of deterioration in cardiovascular status. 5. The results suggest that trimetazidine and propranolol at the doses studied have similar efficacy in patients with stable angina pectoris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
