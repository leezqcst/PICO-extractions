Aortic valve replacement. A randomized study comparing the Björk-Shiley and Lillehei-Kaster disc valves. Late haemodynamics related to clinical results.

In this study, 78 randomized patients with either Björk-Shiley (B-S) or Lillehei-Kaster (L-K) aortic disc valve prostheses were re-admitted for clinical and haemodynamic evaluation. The patients were selected that those with narrow aortic roots were over-represented. Cine-aortography was carried out in 75 patients and left ventricular catheterisation via the transseptal approach was performed in 42. The clinical improvement was striking, although the number of patients still incapacitated was relatively large in patients with the small L-K valves (Nos. 14 & 16). Peak-to-peak and mean systolic pressure differences across the valves were significantly lower in the B-S than in the L-K valves, particularly when the small valve sizes were compared. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), which was elevated in most patients before operation, decreased significantly to normal levels in the B-S group. In the L-K group, LVEDP did not decrease significantly and was on the average still above the normal level after operation, probably due to the relatively large pressure gradients. The study indicates that the L-K valves Nos. 14 & 16 in particular represents a resistance to flow that is too large to be acceptable in clinical practice.
