Long-term evaluation of tamsulosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia: placebo-controlled, double-blind extension of phase III trial. Tamsulosin Investigator Group.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of once-daily tamsulosin (0.4 and 0.8 mg), a unique selective alpha1A-adrenoceptor antagonist in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
METHODS This trial extended a 13-week, Phase III multicenter placebo-controlled, double-blind outpatient trial for an additional 40 weeks. Of 618 patients, 418 (68%) continued into the extension phase on the same double-blind medication and dose. The primary efficacy parameters were total American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score and maximum urinary flow (Qmax).
RESULTS The mean changes in AUA symptom score from baseline to end point were statistically significant in all groups (P <0.001). Significant improvements were observed in Qmax for both tamsulosin groups but not for the placebo group. The statistically significant improvements from baseline in efficacy parameters observed for each tamsulosin group at the end of the 13-week Phase III trial were maintained during the long-term extension phase. Tamsulosin at both dosages was well tolerated as maintenance therapy. Clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not observed. Vital sign changes in either hypertensive or normotensive patients were not clinically significantly different across the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS Tamsulosin once-daily at 0.4 or 0.8 mg was shown to be effective, safe, and well tolerated in the target BPH population during long-term use.
