A controlled crossover trial of fenfluramine in autism.

We report a 12 month double-blind randomized crossover trial of fenfluramine in 20 children with the syndrome of autism. On active drug most of the children lost weight and blood serotonin levels fell by an average of 60%. There was a fall in urinary dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) levels and increased excretion of homovanillic acid (HVA). Some of the children showed improvement in tests of cognitive and language function, although the results did not achieve overall statistical significance. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were obtained in seven subjects on an auditory choice reaction time task. Side effects of the drug included irritability and lethargy. Fenfluramine may have a limited place in the management of some patients with autistic disorder.
