Effectiveness and safety of donepezil in boys with fragile x syndrome: a double-blind, randomized, controlled pilot study.

The present study was designed as a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of donepezil in boys with fragile X syndrome. Twenty boys with fragile X syndrome were randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with either placebo or donepezil (2.5 mg daily for initial 4 weeks followed by 5 mg daily for next 8 weeks). The outcome measures included change in intelligence quotient scores on Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Hindi adaptation by Kulshrestha), change in behavioral scores by Conners 3 Parent Rating Scale (Short) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale, safety, and tolerability of donepezil. The study failed to show significant difference in intelligence quotient and behavioral scales with donepezil therapy over 12 weeks. However, donepezil appeared to be safe and well tolerated.
