Use of abciximab prior to primary angioplasty in STEMI results in early recanalization of the infarct-related artery and improved myocardial tissue reperfusion - results of the Austrian multi-centre randomized ReoPro-BRIDGING Study.

AIMS The aim of the ReoPro-BRIDGING Austrian multi-centre study was to investigate the effects of abciximab (ReoPro) on early reperfusion in ST-elevation myocardial infarction prior to or during primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (pPCI).
METHODS AND RESULTS Fifty-five patients with STEMI were randomized either to start abciximab (0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by 10 microg/min infusion) during the organization phase for pPCI (Group 1, n=28) or immediately before pPCI (Group 2, n=27). The time between first bolus of abciximab and first balloon inflation of pPCI was 83+/-18 vs 21+/-13 min in Group 1 vs 2. The pre-pPCI ST-segment resolution (55+/-21.4% vs 42.4+/-18.2%, p=0.005), TIMI flow grade 3 (29% vs 7%, p=0.042), corrected TIMI frame count (58.4+/-32.7 vs 78.9+/-28.4 frame, p=0.018) %diameter stenosis (76.3 /63.5-100/ vs 100 /73.5-100/; median /interquartile range/, p=0.023), were significantly higher in Group 1 vs Group 2. Quantitative myocardial dye intensity measurement revealed a significantly higher grade of myocardial tissue perfusion (1 /0-9.25/ vs 0 /0-3.0/ grey pixel unit, p=0.048) in Group 1 before pPCI. Rapid release of cardiac enzymes was observed in Group 1 as compared with Group 2: rate of rise of CK was 210+/-209 vs 97+/-95 U/l/h (p=0.015). QRS score indicated a smaller infarct size in Group 1 (4.8+/-3.8 vs 7.6+/-3.5, p=0.011) on day 7.
CONCLUSION The use of abciximab in the organization phase for pPCI results in signs of early recanalization of the infarct-related artery and a subsequent improved myocardial tissue reperfusion.
