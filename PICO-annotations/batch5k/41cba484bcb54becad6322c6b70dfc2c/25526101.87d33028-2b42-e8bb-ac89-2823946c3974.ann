T1	Participants 0 116	TRANSCONJUNCTIVAL NONVITRECTOMIZING VITREOUS SURGERY VERSUS 25-GAUGE VITRECTOMY IN PATIENTS WITH EPIRETINAL MEMBRANE
T2	Participants 447 527	83 phakic eyes of 83 consecutive patients with an idiopathic epiretinal membrane
T3	Participants 772 834	Thirty-nine eyes of the Standard-group and 40 of the NVS-group
T4	Participants 870 1508	Mean best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly in both groups, with a significant better result at 12 months in NVS-group (P = 0.039; t-test). Central retinal thickness decreased significantly in both groups (P < 0.001, Tukey test), without significant difference between the two groups at any time point. At 12 months, nuclear density increased significantly in the Standard-group (analysis of variance, P < 0.001), and it did not change in the NVS-group (analysis of variance, P = 0.537). Epiretinal membrane recurred in 5.1% of eyes in the Standard-group and in 7.5% of eyes in the NVS-group (Fisher's exact test, P = 1.000).
