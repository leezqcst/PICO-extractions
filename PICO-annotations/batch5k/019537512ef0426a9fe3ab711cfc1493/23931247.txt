Ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block within travenous dexketoprofen improves postoperative analgesia in abdominal hysterectomies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE In this study, our aim was to evaluate the effects of intravenous dexketoprofen trometamol with ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block on analgesic quality and morphine consumption after total abdominal hysterectomy operations.
METHODS We conducted this randomized controlled clinical study on 61 patients. The study was conducted in the operation room, post-anesthesia care unit, and inpatient clinic. We randomly grouped the 61 patients into control group (group C), block group (group B) and dexketoprofen-block group (group DB). Before the skin incision performed after anesthesia induction, we performed ilioinguinal iliohypogastric block (group C given saline and group P and DB given levobupivacaine). In contrast to group C and B, group DB was given dexketoprofen. We administered morphine analgesia to all patients by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) during the postoperative 24 hours. We recorded Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), satisfaction scores, morphine consumption and side effects during postoperative 24 hours.
RESULTS We found the DB group’s VAS scores to be lower than the control group and block group’s (p < 0.05) values at postoperative 1st, 2nd, 6th and 12th hours. VAS scores of group C were higher than of group B at postoperative fi rst 2 hours. Time to fi rst PCA demand was longer, morphine consumption values were lower and satisfaction scores were higher in group DB than in the other two groups (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS Ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block with IV dexketoprofen increases patient satisfaction by decreasing opioid consumption, increasing patient satisfaction, which suggests that dexketoprofen trometamol is an effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic in postoperative analgesia.
