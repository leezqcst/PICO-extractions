METHODS We randomly assigned 129 H. pylori infected patients with severe epigastric pain, without gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms, to receive twice daily treatment with 300 mg of ranitidine, 1000 mg of amoxicillin, and 500 mg of clarithromycin for 7 days and 124 such patients to receive identical-appearing placebos
Participants 633 789 3
RESULTS Treatment was successful (decrease of symptoms at 12 months) in 62% of patients in the active-treatment group and in 60% of the placebo group (N.S.)

CONCLUSIONS Although eradicating H. pylori is not likely to relieve symptoms in the majority of patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, a small proportion of H. pylori-infected patients may benefit from eradication treatmen
