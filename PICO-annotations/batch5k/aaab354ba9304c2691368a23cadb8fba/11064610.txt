Comparison of alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil for total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.

We have studied the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil together with propofol in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Sixty patients (age 40-73 yr, 56 male) were assigned randomly to receive alfentanil, fentanyl or sufentanil and propofol. Plasma concentrations of these drugs and times for the plasma concentration to decrease by 50% (t50) and 80% (t80) after cessation of the infusion were determined. Times were recorded to awakening and tracheal extubation. Total dose and plasma concentrations of propofol were similar in all groups. Mean total doses of alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil were 443, 45 and 4.4 micrograms kg-1, respectively. Time to awakening did not differ significantly. In patients receiving fentanyl, the trachea was extubated on average 2 h later than in those receiving sufentanil and 3 h later than in those receiving alfentanil (P < 0.05). The t80 of fentanyl was longer (P < 0.05) than that of alfentanil or sufentanil, and there was a linear correlation between the t80 of the opioid and the time to tracheal extubation (r = 0.51; P < 0.01). However, the t50 values for these opioids were similar and did not correlate with recovery time. In conclusion, patients undergoing CABG and who were anaesthetized with fentanyl and propofol needed mechanical ventilatory support for a significantly longer time than those receiving alfentanil or sufentanil and propofol. On the basis of the interindividual variation observed, the time to tracheal extubation was most predictable in patients receiving alfentanil and most variable in patients receiving fentanyl, a finding which may be important if the patients are transferred to a step-down unit on the evening of the operation.
