[Efficacy observation on chronic tension-type headache treated with acupuncture at galea tendon-muscle node].

OBJECTIVE To explore the better therapy for chronic tension-type headache (CTTH).
METHODS Two hundred and eighty-eight cases were randomized into a sticking needling group (150 cases) and an acupuncture group (138 cases). In the sticking needling group, the manual sticking needling technique was adopted to stimulate the galea tendon-muscle node. In the acupuncture group, the conventional acupuncture therapy was applied to Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Touwei (ST 18), Hegu (LI 4), etc. The treatment was given once a day, and 30 days made one session. After two sessions of treatment and after three months follow-up, CTTH score (including the score of headache attack frequency and the score of headache severity) was observed and compared before and after treatment separately. The efficacy was evaluated in two groups.
RESULTS CTTH score was all reduced after treatment in the two groups (both P<0.01), the score in the sticking needling group was lower than that in the acupuncture group (2.38 +/- 1.22 vs 4.16 +/- 2.54, P < 0.01). The effective rate was 97.3% (146/150) in the sticking needling group, which was better than 88.4% (122/138) in the acupuncture group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION The manual sticking needling technique at galea tendon-muscle node achieves the superior results of reducing the pain attack frequency and severity of CTTH as compared with the acupuncture therapy of the routine acupoint selection.
