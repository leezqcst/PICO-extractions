Who is at low risk for cardiovascular disease? An assessment of different definitions.

BACKGROUND There is little information regarding the determinants and trends of the prevalence of low cardiovascular risk factor (RF) profile in the general population. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and trends of low RF profile in the Swiss population according to different definitions.
METHODS Population-based cross-sectional studies conducted in 1984-1986 (N=3300), 1988-1989 (N=3331), 1992-1993 (N=3133) and 2003-2006 (N=6170) and restricted to age group 35-75 years. Seven different definitions of low RF profile were used to assess determinants, while two definitions were used to assess trends.
RESULTS Prevalence of low RF profile varied between 6.5% (95% confidence interval: 5.9-7.1) and 9.7% (9.0-10.5) depending on the definition used. This prevalence was higher than in other countries. Irrespective of the definition used, the prevalence of low RF profile was higher in women and in physically active participants, and decreased with increasing age or in the presence of a family history of cardiovascular disease. Using one definition, the prevalence of low RF profile increased from 3.8% (3.1-4.5) in 1984-1986 to 6.7% (6.1-7.3) in 2003-2006; using another definition, the results were 5.9% (5.1-6.8) and 9.7% (9.0-10.5), respectively.
CONCLUSION Switzerland is characterized by a high and increasing prevalence of low RF profile within the age group 35 to 75, irrespective of the criteria used. This high prevalence might partly explain the low and decreasing trend in cardiovascular mortality rates.
