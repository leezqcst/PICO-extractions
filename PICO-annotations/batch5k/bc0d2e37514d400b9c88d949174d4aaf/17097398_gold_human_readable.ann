Participants 207 392 5
BACKGROUND New antibacterial agents with activity against pathogenic strains resistant to established antibiotics are needed to treat patients with secondarily infected dermatitis (SID)
Participants 544 696 9
METHODS Patients with SID were randomly assigned to retapamulin ointment 1% (twice daily [bid]) for 5 days, or oral cephalexin (500 mg bid) for 10 days.
Participants 853 972 3
RESULTS Retapamulin was as effective as cephalexin (clinical success rates at follow-up: 85.9% and 89.7%, respectively)
Participants 1564 1728 5
CONCLUSIONS Retapamulin ointment 1% (bid) for 5 days was as effective as oral cephalexin (bid) for 10 days in treatment of patients with SID, and was well tolerated
