BACKGROUND Primary analysis of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial showed long-term peginterferon therapy did not reduce complications in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis
Participants 585 723 6
METHODS A total of 517 HALT-C patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (90 microg/week); 532 received no additional treatment for 3.5 years
Participants 936 1078 4
RESULTS Patients with cirrhosis (n = 427) reported lower general well-being and more fatigue (P < 0.001) than patients with fibrosis (n = 622)
