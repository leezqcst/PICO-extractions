T1	Participants 1600 1820	CONCLUSION Clinical progression of chronic hepatitis C and maintenance peginterferon therapy led to worsening of symptoms, HRQOL and, in men, sexual health in a large patient cohort followed up over 4 years (NCT00006164)
T2	Participants 936 1078	RESULTS Patients with cirrhosis (n = 427) reported lower general well-being and more fatigue (P < 0.001) than patients with fibrosis (n = 622)
T3	Participants 585 723	METHODS A total of 517 HALT-C patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (90 microg/week); 532 received no additional treatment for 3.5 years
T4	Participants 159 408	BACKGROUND Primary analysis of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial showed long-term peginterferon therapy did not reduce complications in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis
