The influence of penbutolol and placebo on blood sugar levels and insulin consumption in the glucose-controlled insulin infusion system ("artificial endocrine pancreas").

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of 40 mg of the beta-blocker penbutolol (Betapressin TM; Hoechst Ltd., Frankfurt/Main) in comparison to placebo on the insulin consumption on the blood sugar profile in twelve insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) patients. The patients were treated with penbutolol and placebo for a period of three days, and then were examined with the help of the glucose-controlled insulin infusion system. The blood sugar profile and insulin consumption over a 24 hour period was not affected by either penbutolol or placebo, nor could any changes be measured in these parameters when measured after food intake. After a submaximal exercise load on the bicycle ergometer (1 watt per kg body weight) following an evening meal, no difference could be observed between penbutolol and placebo in the above-mentioned parameters. The same was also true for hormonal parameters as STH, ACTH, cortisol, and catecholamines. These findings demonstrated that medication of penbutolol over a three-day period has no influence on the baseline blood sugar profile and insulin consumption or on insulin consumption after food intake during rest and physical exercise.
