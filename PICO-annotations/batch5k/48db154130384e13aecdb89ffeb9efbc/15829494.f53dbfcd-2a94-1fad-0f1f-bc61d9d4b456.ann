T1	Participants 1828 1904	the combination was associated with higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 emesis
T2	Participants 1706 1812	No clear benefit in terms of response rates, median TTP or OS was shown with the combination of TMZ + CDDP
T3	Participants 1472 1619	Toxicity was comparable between the two arms for anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, constipation and arthralgias/myalgias.
T4	Participants 1351 1471	The difference between treatment arms regarding objective response rates, TTP and OS were not statistically significant.
T5	Participants 1269 1349	The median overall survival (OS) was 11.5 months in arm A and 12 months in arm B
T6	Participants 892 1053	Patients received TMZ 200 mg/m(2)/day orally for five consecutive days every 4 weeks or TMZ + CDDP 200 mg/m(2) daily on days 1-5 and 75 mg/m(2) of CDDP on day 1.
T7	Participants 1054 1182	RESULTS Tumor responses (complete and partial responses) were seen in 16 patients (26%) in arm A and 19 patients (29%) in arm B.
T8	Participants 1183 1268	The median time to progression (TTP) was 3.8 months in arm A and 5.8 months in arm B.
T9	Participants 843 890	Patients with cerebral metastases were included
T10	Participants 768 842	Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced between the two arms.
T11	Participants 673 766	PATIENTS AND METHODS From January 2000 to April 2002, 132 patients were enrolled on the study
T12	Participants 498 671	We designed a randomized phase II study to evaluate and compare the activity and safety profile of the combination versus single-agent TMZ in patients with advanced melanoma
T13	Participants 334 497	As demonstrated by in vitro studies, cisplatin (CDDP) is able to down-regulate the AGAT activity, suggesting that CDDP could enhance the antitumor activity of TMZ.
T14	Participants 164 271	Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that produces methyl adducts at the 0.6 position of guanine.
T15	Participants 272 332	The methyl adducts are removed by the DNA repair enzyme AGAT
