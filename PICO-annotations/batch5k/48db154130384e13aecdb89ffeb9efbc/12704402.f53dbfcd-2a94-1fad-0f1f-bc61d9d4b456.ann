T9	Participants 946 1032	Body weight and composition, TEE, REE, and RQ were measured at baseline and at week 16
T10	Participants 443 773	DESIGN Parallel, clinical intervention study of 12 weeks energy restriction (6.5 MJ/day) and 4 weeks energy balance (8.2 MJ/day) in two groups of subjects randomly assigned to either a high-protein (HP) diet (27% of energy (%E) as protein, 45%E as carbohydrate) or a lower-protein (LP) diet (16%E as protein, 57%E as carbohydrate)
T11	Participants 197 441	dietary carbohydrate with protein, during energy restriction, on weight loss, total energy expenditure (TEE), resting energy expenditure (REE), respiratory quotient (RQ), and the thermic effect of feeding (TEF) in subjects with hyperinsulinemia
T12	Participants 0 142	Effect of a high-protein, energy-restricted diet on weight loss and energy expenditure after weight stabilization in hyperinsulinemic subjects
