T1	Participants 1980 2107	CONCLUSION Modest weight loss and modest lower blood pressure each reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, as expected.
T2	Participants 1524 1773	RESULTS During the initial 6-week sibutramine treatment period, systolic blood pressure decreased progressively with increasing weight loss in hypertensive subjects (-8.1±10.5 mm Hg with <5 kg weight loss to -10.8±11.0 mm Hg with ⩾5 kg weight loss).
T3	Participants 603 788	SUBJECTS/METHODS A total of 9804 male and female subjects, aged 55 years or older, with a body mass index of 27-45 kg m(-2) were included in this current subanalysis of the SCOUT trial.
T4	Participants 133 407	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes (SCOUT) trial showed a significantly increased relative risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events, but not mortality, in overweight and obese subjects receiving long-term sibutramine treatment with diet and exercise
