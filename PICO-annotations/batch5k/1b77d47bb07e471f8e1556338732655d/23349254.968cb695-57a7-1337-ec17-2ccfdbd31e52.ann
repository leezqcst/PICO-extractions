T1	Participants 405 475	This double-blind study included 18 members of the Polish Rowing Team.
T2	Participants 141 403	This investigation examined the effect of supplementation with Biostimine, extract from Aloe arborescens Mill. leaves, on the levels of pro-oxidant-antioxidant equilibrium markers and anti- and proinflammatory cytokines in rowers subjected to exhaustive exercise
T3	Participants 1391 1517	However, postexercise and recovery levels of TBARS were significantly lower in athletes receiving Biostimine than in controls.
T4	Participants 1662 1855	Consequently, we can conclude that Biostimine supplementation reduces the postexercise level of TBARS by increasing the antioxidant activity of plasma but has no effect on inflammatory markers.
