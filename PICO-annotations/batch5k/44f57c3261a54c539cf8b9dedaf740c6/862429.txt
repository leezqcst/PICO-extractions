Comparison of synemol cream and other topical corticosteroid creams using the vasoconstrictor bioassay.

The human vasoconstrictor bioassay was used to assess the potency of open applications of Synemol cream (0.025%), Diprosone cream (0.05%), Aristocort-A cream (0.5%), and Valisone cream (0.1%). Intensity of vasoconstriction was determined eight, twenty-four, and thirty-two hours after application. Results obtained from the average intensity scores of the three determinations indicated that Synemol cream (0.025%) is actually a more active compound than are Diprosone cream (0.05%), Aristocort-A cream (0.5%), and Valisone cream (0.1%), and that its activity is longer acting.
