T1	Participants 79 140	patients resuscitated from near-fatal ventricular arrhythmias
T2	Participants 230 330	Patients who survive life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias are at risk for recurrent arrhythmias.

T4	Participants 758 919	Patients with ventricular tachycardia also had either syncope or other serious cardiac symptoms, along with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 or less.
T5	Participants 1110 1267	Fifty-six clinical centers screened all patients who presented with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during a period of nearly four years.
T6	Participants 1268 1500	Of 1016 patients (45 percent of whom had ventricular fibrillation, and 55 percent ventricular tachycardia), 507 were randomly assigned to treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 509 to antiarrhythmic-drug therapy.
