T1	Participants 380 785;786 920	The main goal of this study was to determine whether PCI and thrombolytic therapy achieve comparable reperfusion rates, as evidenced by ST-segment resolution. Secondary end points included infarct vessel patency rates before hospital discharge and short- and long-term outcomes. Patients with ischemic chest pain with duration < or =12 hours and no contraindication for thrombolytic therapy were included. RESULTS Between October 1993 and August 1995, 58 patients were randomly assigned to streptokinase (SK) and 54 patients to primary PCI.
