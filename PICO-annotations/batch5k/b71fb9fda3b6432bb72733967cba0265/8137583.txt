Intraperitoneal distribution imaging prior to chromic phosphate (P-32) therapy in ovarian cancer patients.

This study addressed the technique of intraperitoneal distribution imaging (IDI). A literature search (MEDLINE database) revealed wide variations in IDI techniques without a basis for comparison. From April 1990 to September 1992, the authors studied 8 patients (age 43-65 years) with ovarian cancer. A total of 1000 ml of normal saline and 1 mCi of Tc-99m SC was infused intraperitoneally for IDI. In one patient loculation was observed, but only 250 ml of normal saline was infused with Tc-99m SC. A repeat study using our standard technique rendered free intraperitoneal distribution in this patient, as well as in the other seven cases. Some investigators recommend low volumes, but in our experience this produced the finding of pseudoloculation, which could change treatment inappropriately. Although the number of patients studied at our institution was small, administration of 1 liter intraperitoneally provided consistent IDI results.
