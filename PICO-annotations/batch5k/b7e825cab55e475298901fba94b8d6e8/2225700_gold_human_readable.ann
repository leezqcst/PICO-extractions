Mefloquine kinetics in cured and recrudescent patients with acute falciparum malaria and in healthy volunteers

Mefloquine pharmacokinetics were compared in a randomized clinical trial in Thailand among patients with malaria and healthy volunteers
Participants 250 406 8
A single oral dose of 1500 mg mefloquine hydrochloride was administered to 11 patients and 5 volunteers and 750 mg was given to 16 patients and 5 volunteers
Participants 458 822 4
n cured patients taking 750 mg mefloquine, peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were significantly greater than in the patients for whom treatment failed (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively), and plasma mefloquine levels were significantly higher from 8 hours to 18 days after treatment.
