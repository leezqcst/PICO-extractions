T1	Participants 0 110	Mefloquine kinetics in cured and recrudescent patients with acute falciparum malaria and in healthy volunteers
T2	Participants 113 248	Mefloquine pharmacokinetics were compared in a randomized clinical trial in Thailand among patients with malaria and healthy volunteers
T3	Participants 250 406	A single oral dose of 1500 mg mefloquine hydrochloride was administered to 11 patients and 5 volunteers and 750 mg was given to 16 patients and 5 volunteers
T4	Participants 458 822	n cured patients taking 750 mg mefloquine, peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were significantly greater than in the patients for whom treatment failed (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively), and plasma mefloquine levels were significantly higher from 8 hours to 18 days after treatment.
T5	Participants 892 1158	Compared with noninfected volunteers, clinically ill patients displayed a delayed time to reach peak concentration (p less than 0.01) and significantly higher mefloquine plasma levels in the first 2 days after administration of either the 750 mg or the 1500 mg dose.
T6	Participants 1159 1231	Mefloquine AUC was similar in patients with malaria and healthy voluntee
