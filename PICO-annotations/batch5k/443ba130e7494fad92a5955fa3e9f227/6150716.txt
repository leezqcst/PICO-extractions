[The somatostatin infusion test for the evaluation of glucose utilization in bezafibrate medication].

The utilisation of blood glucose may be used for definition of insulin resistance in type II diabetes mellitus. To evaluate this possibility we adapted an infusion test of somatostatin in 10 normal persons (age 26 +/- 3 years, relative body weight 26 +/- 10% according to Broca) in a randomized cross-over therapy with bezafibrate (3 X 200 mg/die). As the coefficient of variation (VC) of measured blood glucose continuously increased the best time of a steady state was between 90 and 130 min after beginning the infusion (mean VC 8.9%). While insulin remained nearly constant (41 (45; 38) microU/ml) blood glucose dropped by about 14% and reached a steady state of 89 (134; 45) mg/dl. During the therapy of bezafibrate blood glucose was significantly decreased by 36% 130 min after beginning the infusion. Although the effect was not significant during the whole time of the steady state it became evident by a negative correlation with lactate (r = -0.687) and pyruvate (r = -0.843). A correlation with a concomitant decrease of triglyceride and cholesterol also induced by bezafibrate could not be proven. The results show that the infusion test of somatostatin is fitted to measure a steady state of blood glucose and insulin and that it is possible by this technique to quantify a changed utilisation of blood glucose induced by specific therapy.
