[Report of a controlled clinical trial of a new synthetic drug, parsalmide, in rheumatic arthropathies (inflammatory and degenerative)].

The anti-inflammatory, analgesic and tranquillizing activity of a synthetic compound called parsalmide was investigated in patients suffering from inflammatory and degenerative rheumatic arthropathies. The study was carried out in 30 subjects using the controlled experiment technique according to the "between patient" pattern, attributing parsalmide and indomethacin at random to two groups. Both preparations were found to possess good anti-inflammatory and analgesic action, comparable clinically and statistically. Tolerance was very good, particularly at gastroenteric level (no side and/or undesired effects were observed) and at the level of haemopoietic, renal and hepatic function.
