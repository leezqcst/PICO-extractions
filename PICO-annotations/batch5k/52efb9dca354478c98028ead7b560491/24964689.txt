Self-management improvement program combined with community involvement in Thai hypertensive population: an action research.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of a program that utilizes community involvement to improve the self-management strategies among people living with hypertension.
MATERIAL AND METHOD Forty-four subjects, aged 35 to 59-year-old, with hypertension in Nakhon Pathom Province, Thailand, were randomly allocated to either an experimental group (n = 22) or a control group (n = 20). The experimental group attended a program to improve self-management methods based on social cognitive theory (SCT). The program lasted 12 weeks, consisted of 1 1/2 hours meeting once a week, including group meetings and home visit monitoring. Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman test were employed to analyze the program's effectiveness.
RESULTS After the program, the mean rank of the perceived self-efficacy for the self-management strategies was statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.023). In the experimental group, after the twelve week, the mean rank of perceived self-efficacy and outcome expectancy increased and diastolic blood pressure decreased after the eight week.
CONCLUSION The program applied social cognitive theory (SCT) to promote self-management techniques, increased the health promoting behavior among hypertensive people.
