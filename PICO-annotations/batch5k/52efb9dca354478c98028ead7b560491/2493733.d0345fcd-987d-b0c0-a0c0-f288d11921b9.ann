T1	Participants 0 122	Intravenous flecainide versus verapamil for acute conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm.
T2	Participants 270 347	40 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFI).
T3	Participants 397 426	rhythm occurred within 1 hour
T4	Participants 431 463	20 patients receiving flecainide
T5	Participants 522 559	3 patients with AFI flecainide failed
T6	Participants 574 596	treated with verapamil
T7	Participants 649 655	1 hour
T8	Participants 909 955	9 of 15 patients (60%) with AF still converted
T9	Participants 961 1075	, 23 of 32 patients (72%) with AF and none of 7 with AFI converted to sinus rhythm after treatment with flecainide
T10	Participants 1120 1248	19 of 22 patients (86%) when AF lasted less than 24 hours and in 4 of 10 (40%) when the arrhythmia lasted greater than 24 hours.
T11	Participants 1289 1324	10 patients (26%) after flecainide.
T12	Participants 1337 1451	flecainide is an effective and safe drug for conversion of paroxysmal AF to sinus rhythm, but ineffective for AFI.
