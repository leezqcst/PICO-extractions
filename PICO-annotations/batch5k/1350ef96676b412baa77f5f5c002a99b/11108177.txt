Measurement of peptidase activity and evaluation of effectiveness of administration of minocycline for treatment of dogs with periodontitis.

OBJECTIVE To determine clinical, enzymatic, and microbiologic effects of controlled-release localized administration of minocycline on dogs with periodontitis.
ANIMALS Five adult Beagles with periodontitis.
PROCEDURE After tooth scaling and root planing, 2 treatment, 1 placebo, and 1 control site were selected for each dog. Treatment sites (n = 10) received a periodontal formulation of minocycline hydrochloride, placebo sites (5) received ointment without minocycline, and control sites (5) did not receive ointment. Treatments were administered 4 times at weekly intervals. Peptidase activity and clinical and microbiologic effects were evaluated and compared among sites for 17 weeks.
RESULTS Bleeding of the gums on probing (BOP) and pocket depth (PD) improved at the treatment site and were maintained for 13 weeks after treatment. However, BOP and PD in placebo and control sites increased from weeks 9 to 17 Peptidase activity in the periodontal pocket decreased noticeably from week 1 to 17, compared with baseline values for the treatment site. However, peptidase activity for placebo and control sites increased and were above baseline values on week 9 and week 13, respectively. Total bacterial counts decreased by 90% for treatment sites and remained at that value for 13 weeks. However, for placebo and control sites, bacterial counts increased and reached the baseline value on week 17.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Increased peptidase activity is correlated with the progression of periodontitis in dogs. Treatment with minocycline, using a localized delivery system, was effective in dogs for at least 13 weeks after cessation of drug administration.
