T1	Participants 201 290	Forty adult patients, ASA I-II were randomly allocated to receive halothane or isoflurane
T2	Participants 292 520	Venous samples for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were taken before anaesthesia, before incision, at the end of anaesthesia and 24 h postoperatively.
T3	Participants 521 604	In both groups, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels remained low throughout the study period.
T4	Participants 605 677	Before incision, in both groups IL-1beta and IFN-gamma showed a decrease
T5	Participants 775 850	By the end of anaesthesia and surgery, IL-1beta had increased significantly
T6	Participants 963 1159	By 24 h postoperatively in both groups, IL-1beta had decreased significantly (p<0.05), whereas IFN-gamma had increased significantly (p<0.05) compared with the end of anaesthesia and surgery level
T7	Participants 1161 1334	Pre-incisionally, IL-2 increased in the halothane group (p<0.01), whereas it decreased significantly in the isoflurane group (p<0.001) compared with the pre-induction level.
T8	Participants 1335 1527	By the end of anaesthesia and surgery and by 24 h postoperatively, IL-2 had decreased significantly in the halothane group (p<0.001), whereas it increased significantly in the isoflurane group
