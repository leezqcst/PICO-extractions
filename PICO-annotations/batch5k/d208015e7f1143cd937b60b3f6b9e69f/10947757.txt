The effect of halothane and isoflurane on plasma cytokine levels.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of halothane vs. isoflurane on cytokine production during minor elective surgery. Forty adult patients, ASA I-II were randomly allocated to receive halothane or isoflurane. Venous samples for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were taken before anaesthesia, before incision, at the end of anaesthesia and 24 h postoperatively. In both groups, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels remained low throughout the study period. Before incision, in both groups IL-1beta and IFN-gamma showed a decrease (p<0.01 for IL-1beta in isoflurane group and p<0.05 for the others) compared with pre-induction. By the end of anaesthesia and surgery, IL-1beta had increased significantly (p<0.05) and IFN-gamma had decreased significantly (p<0.05) in both groups compared with pre-incisional levels. By 24 h postoperatively in both groups, IL-1beta had decreased significantly (p<0.05), whereas IFN-gamma had increased significantly (p<0.05) compared with the end of anaesthesia and surgery level. Pre-incisionally, IL-2 increased in the halothane group (p<0.01), whereas it decreased significantly in the isoflurane group (p<0.001) compared with the pre-induction level. By the end of anaesthesia and surgery and by 24 h postoperatively, IL-2 had decreased significantly in the halothane group (p<0.001), whereas it increased significantly in the isoflurane group (p<0.001) compared with pre-incision and end of anaesthesia and surgery levels, respectively.
