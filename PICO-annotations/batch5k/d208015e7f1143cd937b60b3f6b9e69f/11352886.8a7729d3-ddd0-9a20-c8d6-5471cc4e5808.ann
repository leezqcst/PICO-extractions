T1	Participants 620 844	Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were randomized in a double-blind manner between L-arginine (n=14), GSNO (n=14), or placebo (n=14) administered intravenously for 90 minutes, starting 30 minutes after skin closure.
T2	Participants 845 919	All patients were pretreated with aspirin and given heparin during surgery
T3	Participants 921 1102	Transcranial Doppler recordings were made from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for 4 hours after surgery, beginning 30 minutes after skin closure, and also at 6 and 24 hours.
T4	Participants 1103 1386	There were highly significant reductions in the number of Doppler embolic signals in the L-arginine and GSNO groups; first 4 hours, median (range) number of embolic signals, placebo 44.7 (6 to 778), L-arginine 9.5 (0 to 225), and GSNO 0.8 (0 to 8), both P<0.001 versus control values
T5	Participants 1453 1540	CONCLUSIONS Intravenous L-arginine and GSNO attenuate Doppler embolic signals in humans
