T1	Participants 432 579	Eighty-eight chemotherapy-na√Øve metastatic pancreatic cancer patients were randomized for treatment with gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus erlotinib.
T2	Participants 692 953	Disease control rate (64% vs. 25%; P < 0.001), progression-free survival (median 3.8 vs. 2.4 months; P < 0.001), and overall survival (median 7.2 vs. 4.4 months; P < 0.001) were better in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group than in the gemcitabine alone group.
T3	Participants 955 1244	n the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group, disease control (85% vs. 33%; P = 0.001), progression-free survival (median 5.9 vs. 2.4 months; P = 0.004), and overall survival (median 8.7 vs. 6.0 months; P = 0.044) were better in patients with EGFR mutations than in those without EGFR mutations.
