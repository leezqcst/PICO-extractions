In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, we enrolled 151 patients undergoing TKA. In Group A (n=76 patients), the autotransfusion system was used for a total of 6 hours (intraoperatively and postoperatively) and the WSB was retransfused after processing. In Control Group B (n=75 patients), a regular drain without suction was used.
