Association between platelet activation and fibrinolysis in acute stroke patients.

We aimed to evaluate platelet activation and fibrinolyis in acute atherosclerotic ischemic stroke patients to clarify the relationship between them. Plasma P-selectin antigen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity were determined in 60 acute atherosclerotic stroke patients and matched control subjects. All patients were examined within 72 h after stroke onset. The levels of P-selectin, tPA antigen, and PAI-1 activity were all significantly higher in stroke patients compared with controls (all p < 0.0001); the level of tPA activity was significantly lower in patients than that in controls (p < 0.0001). These markers did not change much at different time points within 72 h. In stroke group, P-selectin concentration was highly correlated to PAI-1 activity (r = 0.8433, p < 0.001), but not to tPA antigen (r = -0.1752, p > 0.05), and tPA activity (r = 0.2465, p>0.05), which was further confirmed in the multiple linear regression analysis (F = 47.052, p < 0.0001). Our results indicate increased platelet activation and decreased fibrinolysis in patients with acute atherosclerotic ischemic stroke. Increased platelet activation may be correlated with decreased fibrinolysis.
