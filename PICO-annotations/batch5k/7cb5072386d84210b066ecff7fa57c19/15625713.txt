Group-based HIV risk reduction intervention for adolescent girls: evidence of feasibility and efficacy.

The purposes of this pilot study were (a) to assess the feasibility of a community-based, small group HIV risk reduction intervention with adolescent girls, and (b) to obtain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of this theoretically-guided intervention using a controlled design. The feasibility of the intervention was demonstrated by successfully implementing it with 33 sexually-active, single girls. Preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the intervention was obtained using a randomized trial with 62 sexually-active, single girls. Data obtained at a 3-month follow-up assessment showed that girls who received the HIV-related intervention improved their HIV-related knowledge and enhanced their motivation for risk reduction compared to girls who received a control (health promotion) intervention. Effect sizes suggest that the HIV intervention also reduced several risk behaviors (e.g., vaginal sex without a condom, giving oral sex, and alcohol and drug use before sex). Challenges to implementation and suggestions for intervention enhancement are discussed.
