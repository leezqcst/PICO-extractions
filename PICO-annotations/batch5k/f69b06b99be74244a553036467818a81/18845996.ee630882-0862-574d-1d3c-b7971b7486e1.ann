T1	Participants 216 433;434 921	To develop a cycle-based risk prediction model for neutropenic complications (NC) during chemotherapy with doxorubicin (DOX) or a pegylated liposomal formulation (PLD) for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS Data analyzed was from a phase III, randomized clinical trial of DOX (60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) or PLD (50 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks) for the first line therapy for MBC (n = 509) (O'Brien et al, Ann Oncol. 2004;15:440-449). NC were defined as an absolute neutrophil count < or =1.5 x 10(9) cells/L (ie, > or =grade II) before the next cycle, febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with a documented infection. Patient and hematologic factors potentially associated with NC were evaluated
