T1	Participants 214 489	ncluded were 98 subjects who underwent cardiac catheterization and were randomized to forced diuresis with i.v. crystalloid, furosemide, mannitol (if pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was < 20 mmHg), and low dose dopamine versus intravenous crystalloid and matching placebos
T2	Participants 491 580	Baseline and postcatheterization serum Cr levels were analyzed in a longitudinal fashion,
T3	Participants 701 841	The mean age, baseline serum Cr, and Cr clearance (CrCl) were 69.3 +/- 10.8 years, 2.5 +/- 0.9 mg/dL, and 31.4 +/- 12.1 mL/min, respectively
T4	Participants 1203 1338	For any given individual, a rise in Cr of < or = 0.5 mg/dL in the first 24 hours after contrast exposure predicted a favorable outcome.
