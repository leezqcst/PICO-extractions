Erythropoiesis after therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin: a dose-response study in anemic cancer surgery patients
Participants 126 291 5
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Preoperative treatment with 600 U/kg of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) effectively increases erythropoiesis in cancer patients.
Participants 436 801 8
MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty anemic sideropenic patients (hemoglobin </=110 g/l; serum iron <600 microg/l) with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract were randomly allocated to two groups: the first (n = 10) received 400 U/kg of r-Hu EPO divided in 4 doses (100 U/kg each, every 4 days); the second (n = 10) received 200 U/kg of r-HuEPO (50 U/kg each, every 4 days).
Participants 1248 1409 3
CONCLUSION The r-HuEPO dose of 400 U/kg appears significantly more effective than the 200 U/kg to stimulate erythropoiesis in anemic sideropenic cancer patients.
