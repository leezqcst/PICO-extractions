T1	Participants 1248 1409	CONCLUSION The r-HuEPO dose of 400 U/kg appears significantly more effective than the 200 U/kg to stimulate erythropoiesis in anemic sideropenic cancer patients.
T2	Participants 884 963	RESULTS After treatment, the serum iron level significantly rose in both groups
T3	Participants 436 801	MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty anemic sideropenic patients (hemoglobin </=110 g/l; serum iron <600 microg/l) with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract were randomly allocated to two groups: the first (n = 10) received 400 U/kg of r-Hu EPO divided in 4 doses (100 U/kg each, every 4 days); the second (n = 10) received 200 U/kg of r-HuEPO (50 U/kg each, every 4 days).
T4	Participants 126 290	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Preoperative treatment with 600 U/kg of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) effectively increases erythropoiesis in cancer patients
T5	Participants 0 123	Erythropoiesis after therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin: a dose-response study in anemic cancer surgery patients
