T1	Participants 1744 1992	CONCLUSIONS Intramuscular administration of 5000 IU of vitamin A three times per week for four weeks reduced biochemical evidence of vitamin A deficiency and slightly decreased the risk of chronic lung disease in extremely-low-birth-weight infants.
T2	Participants 839 1006	RESULTS By 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, 59 of the 405 infants (15 percent) in the vitamin A group and 55 of the 402 infants (14 percent) in the control group had died.
T3	Participants 473 689	METHODS We performed a multicenter, blinded, randomized trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of this regimen as compared with sham treatment in 807 infants in need of respiratory support 24 hours after birth.
T4	Participants 151 280	BACKGROUND Vitamin A supplementation may reduce the risk of chronic lung disease and sepsis in extremely-low-birth-weight infants
T5	Participants 282 472	The results of our pilot study suggested that a dose of 5000 IU administered intramuscularly three times per week for four weeks was more effective than the lower doses given in past trials.
