Tinidazole and metronidazole in hepatic amoebiasis.

The efficacy of metronidazole and tinidazole has been compared in 31 patients with hepatic amoebiasis. Only those with unequivocal clinical, radiological and laboratory evidence of hepatic amoebiasis were included; diagnostic and therapeutic aspiration was performed where necessary. 15 patients received metronidazole and 16 tinidazole, in random order. The 2 groups were comparable. Both drugs were given orally in a single daily dose of 2g for a minimum of 3 days, with treatment extended if considered clinically advisable. 12 of 15 patients (80%) were cured with metronidazole given for an average period of 7 days (range 4 to 14 days). 15 of 16 patients (93.8%) given tinidazole were cured and the mean duration of treatment was 4 days (range 3 to 6 days). There were fewer side-effects with tinidazole. In this study of hepatic amoebiasis in Bangladesh, tinidazole was found to be superior to metronidazole in overall efficacy because a shorter course of treatment was necessary and it caused fewer side-effects.
