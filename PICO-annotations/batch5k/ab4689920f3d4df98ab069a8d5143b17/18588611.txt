A comparison between the effect of oxytocin only and oxytocin plus propranolol on the labor (a double blind randomized trial).

OBJECTIVE The comparison between the effect of oxytocin alone or in combination with propranolol on labor.
METHODS A double blind randomized controlled trial was performed on 150 nulliparas with a gestational age of 39-41 weeks of pregnancy and a Bishop score of < or =5. In the first group (oxytocin group = 75), oxytocin alone was used for induction of labor. In the second group (propranolol group = 75 cases), before the beginning of oxytocin, 2 mg propranolol was slowly injected intravenously then the oxytocin was initiated.
RESULTS The number of patients who delivered in the first day showed no difference between the two groups. The mean duration for obtaining good contractions was shorter in the propranolol group in both the first and second day of induction The mean interval between the beginning of induction until the beginning of active phase at the first day of induction was shorter in the propranolol group. The mean interval between the beginning of induction until delivery at the first day of induction was shorter in the propranolol group. The amount of necessary oxytocin for the first day of induction was less in the propranolol group.
CONCLUSION Propranolol may shorten the induction duration and labor and reduce the amount of necessary oxytocin.
