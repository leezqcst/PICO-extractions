A double blind randomized controlled trial was performed on 150 nulliparas with a gestational age of 39-41 weeks of pregnancy and a Bishop score of < or =5. In the first group (oxytocin group = 75), oxytocin alone was used for induction of labor. In the second group (propranolol group = 75 cases), before the beginning of oxytocin, 2 mg propranolol was slowly injected intravenously then the oxytocin was initiated.
