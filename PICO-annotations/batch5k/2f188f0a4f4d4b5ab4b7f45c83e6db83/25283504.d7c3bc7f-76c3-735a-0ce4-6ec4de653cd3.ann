T1	Participants 1481 1573	CONCLUSION The PK/PD model predicted the effective dose to be 0.1 mg/kg in healthy subjects.
T2	Participants 901 1040	RESULTS A two-compartment PK model with constant iv input and first-order output was used to describe the kinetic process of plasma uricase
T3	Participants 325 603	METHODS A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 40 healthy Chinese subjects (4 groups of 10 subjects each, placebo 4:1 ratio) who received infusions of uricase (single doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg; multiple doses of 0.2 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 7 d)
T4	Participants 137 324	AIM Pharmacodynamic analysis of intravenous recombinant urate oxidase produced by Escherichia coli was performed in healthy subjects using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model.
T5	Participants 0 135	Pharmacodynamic analysis of intravenous recombinant urate oxidase using an indirect pharmacological response model in healthy subjects.
