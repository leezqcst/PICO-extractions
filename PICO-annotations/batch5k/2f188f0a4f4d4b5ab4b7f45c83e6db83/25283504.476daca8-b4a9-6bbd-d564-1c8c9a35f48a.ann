T1	Participants 0 135	Pharmacodynamic analysis of intravenous recombinant urate oxidase using an indirect pharmacological response model in healthy subjects.
T2	Participants 157 206	analysis of intravenous recombinant urate oxidase
T3	Participants 380 480	study was performed in 40 healthy Chinese subjects (4 groups of 10 subjects each, placebo 4:1 ratio)
T4	Participants 622 742	determined through plasma uricase activity, and PD profiles were established using uric acid levels in plasma and urine.
T5	Participants 909 1040	A two-compartment PK model with constant iv input and first-order output was used to describe the kinetic process of plasma uricase
T6	Participants 1424 1480	nfusions of uricase were well tolerated in all subjects.
T7	Participants 1492 1573	The PK/PD model predicted the effective dose to be 0.1 mg/kg in healthy subjects.
T8	Participants 1574 1696	The excretion rate of uric acid in urine may be used as a new index for pharmacological effects in further clinical trials
