A shortened versus standard matched postpartum magnesium sulphate regimen in the treatment of eclampsia: a randomised controlled trial.

Magnesium sulphate is currently the most ideal drug for the treatment of eclampsia but its use in Nigeria is still limited due its cost and clinicians inexperience with the drug. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a shortened postpartum course of magnesium sulphate is as effective as the standard Pritchard regimen in controlling fits in eclampsia Between January and June 2011, 98 eclamptic mothers presenting at the labour ward of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital were randomised to receive either the standard Pritchard regimen of magnesium sulphate or a shortened postpartum course in which only two doses of intramuscular magnesium sulphate is given four hours apart. The maternal and fetal outcomes were compared. The primary outcome measure was recurrence of fits. The recurrence of fits and other maternal complications were similar in the two groups. The total dosage of magnesium sulphate in the shortened group was reduced by 40% in 66% of patients. The shortened postpartum course of magnesium sulphate is as effective as the standard Pritchard regimen in the management of eclampsia.
