Comparison of regimens of amphotericin B deoxycholate in kala-azar.

A total of 288 parasitologically proved patients of kala-azar were randomly allocated to three treatment groups. Patients in groups A, B and C received amphotericin B (AMB) in a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day, 0.75 mg/kg bw/day and 0.5 mg/kg bw/day for 20 days respectively. Apparent cure (afebrile at the end of therapy) occurred in all patients and parasitological cure in 96 (100%), 92 (96%) and 84 (88%) patients respectively in groups A, B and C. Ultimate cure (no relapse in six months of follow up) occurred in 95 (99%), 87 (91%) and 79 (82%) patients in groups A, B and C respectively. The difference between the ultimate cure in the three groups was significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events (rise in serum creatinine and fall in serum potassium, loss of appetite and shivering, rigor and fever during infusion indicative of renal, GIT and infusion related toxicities respectively) was similar in the three groups. This study showed that amphotericin B should be given at a dosage of 1 mg/kg bw/day for 20 days for Indian kala-azar patients to minimise relapses and prevent development of drug unresponsiveness.
