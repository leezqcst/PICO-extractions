Comparison of split-course radiation therapy and continuous radiation therapy for unresectable bronchogenic carcinoma: 5 year results.

One hundred and eighty-eight patients with inoperable or unresectable bronchogenic carcinoma were stratified by cell type, TNM staging, and prior surgery and then randomized into two treatment groups: continuous radiation therapy and split-course radiation therapy. There was no difference in clinical or objective improvement in the two groups. Survival rates for cases of squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and adrenocarcinoma were the same after both regimens of therapy. Split-course therapy resulted in a significantly better survival rate in cases of large cell carcinoma but the number of cases was small. We doubt that the difference is clinically significant. Objective roentgenographic response was accompanied by improved survival in squamous cell carcinoma, but not in the other three cell types. Split-course radiation therapy is superior to continuous radiation therapy because it is better tolerated by the patient and because re-examination of the patient prior to the second half of split-course therapy permits the detection of new metastatic disease that has become manifest during the rest period and spares the patient the futile second half of radiation therapy.
