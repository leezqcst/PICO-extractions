T1	Participants 1684 1829	CONCLUSION The bias of measuring haemoglobin concentration by pulse oximetry is dependent on whether a crystalloid or a colloid fluid is infused.
T2	Participants 892 1226	RESULTS At the end of the infusions of Ringer's acetate, pulse oximetry haemoglobin concentration had decreased more than the true haemoglobin concentration (15 vs. 8%; P < 0.005; n = 10) whereas starch solution decreased pulse oximetry haemoglobin concentration less than true haemoglobin concentration (7 vs. 11%; P < 0.02; n = 20).
T3	Participants 328 532	OBJECTIVE To study the effect of crystalloid and colloid fluid on the accuracy (bias) and precision of pulse oximetry haemoglobin estimation to indicate the venous haemoglobin concentration in volunteers.
T4	Participants 613 673	PARTICIPANTS Ten male volunteers aged 18-28 (mean 22) years.
