T1	Participants 1606 1706	In conclusion, a low dose of amantadine is sufficient in modulating human motor cortex excitability.
T2	Participants 0 76	Modulation of human motor cortex excitability by single doses of amantadine.
T3	Participants 492 647	We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evaluate the effect of single doses of amantadine on human motor cortex excitability in normal subjects.
