[PLACE REMAXOL AS A HEPATOPROTECTOR IN INTENSIVE THERAPY OF PERVASIVE PERITONITIS].

UNLABELLED PERPOSE OF RESEARCH: to evaluate the effectiveness of Remaxol in patients with pervasive peritonitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS assessed the effectiveness of a balanced infusion of the drug (Remaxol) in the treatment of 44 patients agedfrom 18 to 50 years. Patients were devided into 2 groups by the method of envelopes. All patients received a comprehensive differential therapy: 21 patient 1 group consisting of infusion therapy in the postoperative period received Remaxol at a dose of 800 mg/day for 7 days.
RESULTS the comporative assessment of indicators of systemic hemodinamics, oxygen transport, asid base status, glucose, lactose and free radical oxydation. Patients on the first background was used Remaxol have experiensed a more rapid relief of metabolic disorders, endotoxemia and hepatic dysfunction compared with the indices of the 2 group patients. Noted earlier stabilization of rudicators of systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport. This has reduced the duration of respiratory and vasopressor suppot, early start ofparenteral intreduction in case the power (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS this study shows that use of the drug for the purpose of relief Remaxol hepatic dysfunction and prevention of drug liver toxicity in conditions ofperitonitis, after 48 hours of operation, provides a positive dynamics and stabilization ofparameters of central hemodynamics, contributing to the abolition of vasopressor support, and contributes to the effective utilization of oxygen, while providing antioxidant effect.
