T1	Participants 311 489	A numerical plaque index (0-5) is described based on the presence and distribution of plaque in the fissures and over the occlusal surfaces of permanent molar and premolar teeth.
T2	Participants 1083 1181	A group of 10 subjects had plaque scored by index and area after suspending toothcleaning for 48 h
T3	Participants 1458 1600	In conclusion, the occlusal fissure plaque index was easy to apply, repeatable and sufficiently sensitive to detect plaque removed by brushing
