The influence of type of incision on the success rate of implant integration at stage II uncovering surgery.

In 1991, the Dental Implant Clinical Research Group comprising 30 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers and two dental schools initiated a long-term clinical study to investigate the clinical performance of implants within the Spectra-System (Core-Vent Corporation, Las Vegas, NV). This article focuses on a portion of the study database related to incision type, implant success rates, and response of crestal bone up to the time of surgical uncovering. The crestal incision was used for 1,705 implants (381 patients) and the remote incision for 593 implants (141 patients). No statistically significant difference (P = .092 chi-square statistic) was found in implant integration or the response of crestal bone.
