Behavioral changes in autistic individuals as a result of wearing ambient transitional prism lenses.

A double-blind crossover design was used to assess the efficacy of wearing ambient lenses to reduce the behavioral symptoms of autism. Eighteen autistic individuals, ranging in age from 7 to 18 years, participated in the study. Behavior, attention, and orientation were evaluated at 1 1/2 months, 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months. Compared to the placebo condition, the results showed a decrease in behavior problems at the 1 1/2 and 2 month assessment periods and a slight loss of these benefits at the 3 and 4 month assessment periods. These findings support the prediction that ambient lenses, worn without engaging in visual-motor exercises, have positive effects on autistic individuals.
