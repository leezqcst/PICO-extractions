Treatment of gastrointestinal cancer: the Southeastern Cancer Study Group experience, 1979 to 1983.

The treatment of gastrointestinal cancer was studied in 20 phase I, II, and III clinical trials from 1979 to 1983 at 30 member institutions of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG). These studies used both new and commercially available drugs, as well as surgery and/or radiation therapy in 1,087 patients. No significant benefit was seen from 18 agents, and one agent is still under evaluation. Unfortunately, no recommendations can be drawn from these studies that would alter presently accepted methods of management. Adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract remains a major challenge to tumor biologists and clinical oncologists because it is generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, yet common enough to represent a vital public health concern in America.
