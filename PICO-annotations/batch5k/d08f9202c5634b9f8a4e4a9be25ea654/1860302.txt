Effect of ranitidine on the disposition of orally and intravenously administered triazolam.

The effect of orally administered ranitidine on the pharmacokinetic properties of orally and intravenously administered triazolam was determined. Twelve healthy males with a mean age of 35 years were enrolled in this four-way, randomized, crossover study. Each subject received a total of four treatments, each separated by one week. The treatments consisted of (1) one orally administered 0.25-mg triazolam tablet after treatment with ranitidine; (2) one orally administered 0.25-mg triazolam tablet, with no ranitidine pretreatment; (3) a 0.25-mg intravenous dose of triazolam after treatment with ranitidine; and (4) a 0.25-mg intravenous dose of triazolam, with no ranitidine pretreatment. Ranitidine pretreatment consisted of five 150-mg oral doses (as the hydrochloride salt) given every 12 hours; the last dose was given two hours before triazolam was administered. Blood samples were taken at intervals up to 12 hours after triazolam treatment. Serum triazolam concentrations were measured by modified high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic values were calculated. Pretreatment with ranitidine had no effect on the disposition of intravenously administered triazolam but significantly increased the area under the serum drug concentration-time curve of oral triazolam. Ranitidine pretreatment had no effect on triazolam's terminal elimination rate constant or on the time to reach maximum serum triazolam concentration. Ranitidine pretreatment increased the systemic availability of triazolam by increasing its absorption.
