T1	Participants 47 138	teeth restored with fiber reinforced composite posts and three kinds of resin core material
T2	Participants 167 214	fracture resistances of pulpless teeth restored
T3	Participants 220 252	FRC (Fiber Reinforced Composite)
T4	Participants 307 390	A total of 42 recently extracted upper incisors were randomly divided into 3 groups
T5	Participants 738 783	size and shape were identical in the 3 groups
T6	Participants 904 981	at 130 degrees to the long axis of the teeth on an universal testing machine.
T7	Participants 785 845	All teeth were fully covered with polycarbonate resin crowns
T8	Participants 1283 1421	The composite restoration of FRC posts combined with resin core and resin crown can improve the fracture resistance of the pulpless roots.
T9	Participants 1422 1495	The strength of resin core material can be increased by hot-press methods
