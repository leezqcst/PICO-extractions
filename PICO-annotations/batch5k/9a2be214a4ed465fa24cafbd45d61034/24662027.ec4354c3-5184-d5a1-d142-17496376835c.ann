T1	Participants 0 91	Pegylated feline granulocyte colony-stimulating factor increases neutrophil levels in cats.
T2	Participants 146 191	granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
T3	Participants 265 298	treatment for neutropenic animals
T4	Participants 230 245	G-CSF (HuG-CSF)
T5	Participants 344 398	associated with adverse effects, including neutropenia
T6	Participants 759 835	higher neutrophil production than HuG-CSF after the second week of treatment
T7	Participants 849 875	Weekly doses of PegFeG-CSF
T8	Participants 884 975	higher neutrophil counts and showed greater sustained activity than weekly doses of FeG-CSF
T9	Participants 1174 1343	, all HuG-CSF-treated cats developed neutralizing antibodies, suggesting cross-reactive antibodies to endogenous G-CSF in a majority of the cases with severe neutropenia
T10	Participants 1482 1565	, PegFeG-CSF appears to be a superior treatment for neutropenia in feline patients.
T11	Participants 1431 1476	clinically normal neutrophil numbers returned
