T1	Participants 0 57	Treatment of hepatitis B virus infection with interferon.
T2	Participants 58 100	Factors predicting response to interferon.
T3	Participants 212 242	therapy of chronic hepatitis B
T4	Participants 404 451	Twenty-one pretreatment variables were assessed
T5	Participants 514 589	114 patients given alpha-interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection
T6	Participants 626 749	a minimum of 90 million units per m2 total dose over 12 weeks, a negative anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody status
T7	Participants 1091 1193	analysis, hepatitis B virus DNA, AST and a history of acute hepatitis predicted response independently
T8	Participants 1270 1440	a negative anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody status, with either a positive history of acute icteric hepatitis and AST greater than 45 IU per liter or no history
T9	Participants 1585 1739	The loss of HBsAg in addition to HBeAg and hepatitis B virus DNA was more likely to occur in patients with chronic infection of less than 2 years duration
