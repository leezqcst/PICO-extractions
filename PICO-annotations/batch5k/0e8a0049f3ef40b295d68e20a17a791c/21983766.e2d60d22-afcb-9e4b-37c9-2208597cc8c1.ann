T1	Participants 1 133	Comparative effects of nebivolol and valsartan on atrial electromechanical coupling in newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertensive patients
T2	Participants 253 349	Increased atrial electromechanical coupling time interval measured by tissue Doppler is accepted
T3	Participants 678 757	60 newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertensive patients with no other systemic disease
T4	Participants 1037 1143	three months after treatment to compare the effects of the two drugs on atrial electromechanical coupling.
T5	Participants 1152 1296	Baseline blood pressures, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, and atrial electromechanical coupling were similar in both groups
T6	Participants 1509 1625	Prolonged interatrial electromechanical time intervals in hypertensives are improved with antihypertensive treatment
T7	Participants 1307 1393	Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure after treatment, with similar efficacy
