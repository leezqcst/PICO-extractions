Limited effects of micronutrient supplementation on strength and physical function after abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy.

BACKGROUND Tissue injury following ischemia-reperfusion is mediated in part by free oxygen radicals. We hypothesized that perioperative micronutrient supplementation would augment antioxidant defenses, minimize muscle injury, and minimize postoperative decreases in muscle strength and physical function following abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy.
SETTING A university-affiliated hospital and regional referral center.
DESIGN A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of supplementation with beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, zinc, and selenium for a period of 2-3 weeks prior to surgery and 1 week thereafter.
STUDY POPULATION Patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy (n=18 per group).
PRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS Handgrip and other measures of strength and physical function.
RESULTS Handgrip and quadriceps strength decreased following surgery, but not to a significantly different extent in the placebo and supplemented groups. Self-rated physical function decreased following surgery in the placebo group and was preserved in the supplemented group.
CONCLUSIONS Perioperative supplementation with micronutrients with antioxidant properties has limited effects on strength and physical function following major elective surgery.
