A workplace intervention for increasing outdoor workers' use of solar protection.

OBJECTIVES Outdoor workers are at high risk of developing skin cancer. Primary prevention in this group can potentially reduce the incidence of skin cancer, and also potentiates the spontaneous remission of existing solar keratoses. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a solar protection intervention targeting outdoor workers.
METHODS Outdoor workers were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 65) or control group (n = 77). The intervention group received individual skin screening by a dermatologist and participated in an education session. Pre- and posttest outcome measures included solar protection behavior (assessed using a validated diary), knowledge, and attitudes.
RESULTS There was a significant increase (16%) in the percentage of outdoor workers who were using a high level of solar protection at posttest compared to pretest in the intervention group, but there was no change in the control group. Although both groups improved in their knowledge score, the intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement at posttest. No changes in attitudes were detected.
CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that changes in solar protection are achievable with outdoor workers.
