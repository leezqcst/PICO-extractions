Fifty-one patients with raised intraocular pressure (IOP) were treated for up to four years with one of three ophthalmic solutions: 0.5% levobunolol, 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol. The study was conducted as a double-masked, randomised trial in which medications were administered twice daily to both eyes.
