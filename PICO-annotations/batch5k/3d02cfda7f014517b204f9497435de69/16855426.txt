Rotigotine transdermal patch enables rapid titration to effective doses in advanced-stage idiopathic Parkinson disease: subanalysis of a parallel group, open-label, dose-escalation study.

OBJECTIVE Rotigotine (Neupro) is formulated as a transdermal delivery system designed to provide a selective, non-ergot D3/D2/D1 agonist to the systemic blood flow over a 24-hour period. In clinical trials, patches were applied once daily and uptitrated to the individual effective dose in increments of 2 mg/24 h every week. The aim of this analysis was to determine the safety of a more rapid titration of rotigotine by assessing the tolerability of escalating transdermal doses of rotigotine given in 2 different titration schemes.
METHODS We analyzed the safety of rotigotine in 2 groups of patients with advanced stage Parkinson Disease. The starting dose of 4 mg/24 h was increased every week by 2 mg/24 h in the slow-titration group and 4 mg/24 h in the fast-titration group. The primary focus of this subanalysis was the separate tolerability of rotigotine in each randomized treatment arm, during the dose-escalation period. However, the 2 titration schemes were also compared with each other.
RESULTS The dose of first reported nausea and/or vomiting was 8 mg/24 h for the fast-titration group and 4 mg/ 24 h for the slow-titration group. There were no remarkable differences concerning the side-effect profile between the 2 different titration schemes.
CONCLUSIONS The fast-titration regimen had a similar adverse event profile to slower titration, and allowed rotigotine to be introduced quickly. This subanalysis suggests that rotigotine may be uptitrated more rapidly.
