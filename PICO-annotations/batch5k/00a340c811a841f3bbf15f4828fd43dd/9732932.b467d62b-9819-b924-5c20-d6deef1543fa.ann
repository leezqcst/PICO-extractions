T1	Participants 0 129	Relationship between biliary and serum bile acids and response to ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
T2	Participants 235 274	patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
T3	Participants 1053 1136	because in some patients, plasma but not biliary bile acids were enriched with UDCA
T4	Participants 305 479	determine whether the degree of enrichment of bile correlated with that of serum and whether either of these measures correlated with improvement in measures of liver disease
T5	Participants 616 765	The percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid in bile increased by 42% in the UDCA group (n = 61) compared with 8% in the placebo group (n = 57) (p < 0.0001
T6	Participants 1138 1202	Changes in biliary ursodeoxycholic acid correlated significantly
T7	Participants 1588 1674	patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis
