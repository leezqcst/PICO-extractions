A randomized crossover study comparing patient preference for tamsulosin and silodosin in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Patient preference for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment with the Î±(1)-blockers, tamsulosin or silodosin, was compared using patient-reported outcomes. Japanese patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH were randomly allocated to either the T-S group (tamsulosin 0.2 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then silodosin 4 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks) or the S-T group (silodosin 4 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks then tamsulosin 0.2 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was the preferred drug for treatment continuation at 8 weeks, determined by a patient-reported questionnaire. In total, 102 patients (mean age 70.3 years) were enrolled and 84 (n = 42 per group) completed the study. A significant difference was observed between the proportion of patients who preferred tamsulosin (59/84 patients; 70.2%) and those who preferred silodosin (18/84 patients; 21.4%). A major reason for preference of either drug was 'good efficacy'. Incidence of adverse effects was significantly lower with tamsulosin (3/91 patients; 3.3%) than with silodosin (25/88 patients; 28.4%). These findings indicate that tamsulosin is very effective for BPH, has few adverse effects and that patients want to continue to use it.
