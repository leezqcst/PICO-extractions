Trial of (+)-cyanidanol-3 in patients with hepatitis B chronic liver disease.

A double-blind controlled trial of 12 months' treatment with (+)-cyanidanol-3 was carried out in 26 patients with chronic hepatitis B liver disease. Treatment did not improve liver blood tests nor histological appearances of the liver, but there was a trend towards reduction of serum titres of hepatitis B surface antigen.
