[Clinical observation on acupuncture for treatment of male osteoporosis].

OBJECTIVE To compare the therapeutic effects of acupuncture combined with drug and simple drug for treatment of male osteoporosis.
METHODS Fifty-five cases were divided into an observation group (25 cases) and a control group (30 cases) randomly. The observation group was treated with acupuncture and moxibustion at Pishu (BL 20), Shenshu (BL 23), Mingmen (GV 4), Shenque (CV 8) and so on combined with taking Alendronate, while the control group was treated with taking Alendronate simply. The improvement of both Integral of Clinical Symptoms (ICS) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of two groups was observed after 6 months treatment.
RESULTS The ICS of two groups after treatment both decreased significantly (both P < 0.001), and the decreasing degree in observation group was more significant than that in control group (P < 0.001). The BMD of lumbar vertebrae and femur in observation group increased obviously than that before treatment (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The increasing degree of BMD of lumbar vertebrae in observation group after treatment was more obvious than that in control group (P < 0.05). There were abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia and other adverse reaction in control group, while the degree and occurrence rate of those in observation group alleviated and decreased obviously.
CONCLUSION The effect of acupuncture combined with drug for treatment of male osteoporosis is good with little adverse reaction. This method is better than taking Alendronate.
