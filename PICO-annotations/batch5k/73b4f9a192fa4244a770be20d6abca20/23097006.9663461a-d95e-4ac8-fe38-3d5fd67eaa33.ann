T1	Participants 0 169	Pulmonary vein re-isolation for atrial fibrillation using duty-cycled phased radiofrequency ablation: safety and efficacy of a primary 2:1 bipolar/unipolar ablation mode
T2	Participants 180 210	Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)
T3	Participants 217 243	phased radiofrequency (RF)
T4	Participants 285 338	the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).
T5	Participants 794 848	PVI was achieved in all patients without complications
T6	Participants 1299 1452	Phased RF energy applied by a 2:1 bipolar/unipolar mode seems safe and effective in redo-PVI procedures, resulting in a mid-term freedom from AF in 86.4%
T7	Participants 1500 1533	times compared with a primary 4:1
T8	Participants 1562 1660	PVI are mainly attributed to a lower incidence of acutely reconnected PVs within the first 30 min.
