T1	Participants 77 94	diabetic patients
T2	Participants 388 458	diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
T3	Participants 565 659	4809 patients undergoing PCI with stent implantation were randomized to tirofiban or abciximab
T4	Participants 661 741	At the time of enrollment, patients were stratified according to diabetes status
T5	Participants 743 1037	As compared with non-diabetic patients, patients with diabetes (n=1117) showed similar 30-day ischemic outcomes, an increased incidence of any target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 6 months (10.3% versus 7.8%; P= 0.008), and a trend toward higher 1-year mortality (2.5% versus 1.6%; P=0.056)
T6	Participants 1289 1395	, the composite of death, MI, or any TVR occurred in 15.7% and in 16.9% of tirofiban and abciximab patient
T7	Participants 1501 1606;1607 1957	The 1-year mortality was 2.1% in the tirofiban group and 2.9% in the abciximab group (HR 0.74; P= 0.436). CONCLUSIONS Among diabetic patients undergoing PCI, tirofiban and abciximab were associated with comparable event rates, including similar rates of 6-month TVR and 1-year mortality. These findings suggest that the non-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa properties of abciximab do not translate into a discernible long-term clinical benefit among diabetic patients
