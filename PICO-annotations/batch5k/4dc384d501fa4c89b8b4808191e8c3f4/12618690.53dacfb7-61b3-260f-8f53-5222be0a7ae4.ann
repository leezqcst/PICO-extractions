T1	Participants 669 1168	METHODS This is a cooperative, multicenter, retrospective review of 832 patients stratified by CEAP classification. The series consisted of 300 patients with C4 CVI, 119 patients with C5 CVI, and 413 patients with C6 CVI. A subset of 92 patients with C4 disease were prospectively randomized, and ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) was determined preoperatively and postoperatively. All patients underwent duplex US scanning to document reflux in the deep, superficial, and perforating venous systems.
T2	Participants 1268 1417;1418 2461	Uniformity was attempted by adoption of the senior author's protocol and technique through on-site preceptorship in each surgeon's operative theater. RESULTS This technique interrupted 3 to 14 (mean, 7) incompetent perforating veins per patient. Of the 832 patients undergoing SEPS, 460 (55%) underwent saphenous vein ligation and stripping at the same operation. In 92% ulcers healed or were significantly improved within 4 to 14 weeks. In 64 (8%) patients, ulcers failed to heal or there was no benefit from the operation. Thirty-two patients (4%) experienced recurrent ulceration or skin deterioration at 6 months-2 years (mean, 15 mo). Repeat SEPS was successful in 25 of these 96 patients, and deep valve repair was successful in 4 patients. In the 92 randomized patients with C4 disease, 41 refused postoperative AVP, leaving 51 compliant patients. The SEPS group (n = 25) had significantly reduced AVP (P <.01) compared with the control group (n = 26). Complications in 825 patients were less than 3% and consisted mostly of transient neurologic disorders (eg, paradysthesia), but deep venous thrombosis occurred in 2 patients, with pulmonary embolus in 1. No operative deaths occurred.
