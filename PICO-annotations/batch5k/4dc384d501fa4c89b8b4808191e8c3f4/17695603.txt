Eight in-office tooth whitening systems evaluated in vivo: a pilot study.

This in vivo pilot study evaluated eight products with hydrogen peroxide (HP) concentrations ranging from 15% to 35%. The treatment contact time varied from 15 minutes to 60 minutes. Patients were evaluated for color at baseline, immediately after treatment and at one, two, four and six weeks after treatment using a colorimeter, shade guide and photos. All eight products were effective in bleaching teeth. Colorimeter data for deltaE immediately after treatment was 6.77. At one and six weeks after bleaching, there were 51% and 65% reductions in deltaE, respectively.
