[Effect of treatment of non-nephrotic syndrome IgA nephropathy with Shenyanning].

OBJECTIVE To observe the curative effect of Shenyanning (SYN) on non-nephrotic syndrome IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
METHODS Seventy primary IgAN patients were equally randomized into two groups, the treatment group and the control group, they were orally treated with SYN Decoction (one dose per day) and Losartan (50 mg per day) respectively for 1 year. Efficacy of treatment, Chinese medicine syndrome scores, end-point events occurrence as well as changes of related laboratory indices were observed.
RESULTS The total effective rate in the treatment group was obviously higher than that in the control group (77.1% vs. 54.3%, P < 0.05). After treatment, the Chinese medicine syndrome scores, urinary protein and urinary red-cell count reduced significantly in the treatment group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) and showed significant difference as compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); while the endogenous creatinine clearance was changed insignificantly in both groups. Beside, the occurrence of end-point events in the treatment group was slightly lower than that in the control group, though showed no statistical difference between them.
CONCLUSION The curative effect of SYN in treating IgAN was obviously better than that of simple Western medicine.
