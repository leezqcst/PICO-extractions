Recovery after prolonged anaesthesia for acoustic neuroma surgery: desflurane versus isoflurane.

In this study, 33 patients were randomly assigned to receive desflurane (D) or isoflurane (I) for acoustic neuroma surgery. The time from end of the procedure to spontaneous breathing, extubation, eye-opening, hand-squeezing to command, and ability to state name, birthdate and phone number were recorded. The Steward recovery score was also recorded every five minutes during the first 20 minutes postoperatively and then every 10 to 15 minutes. Groups were similar regarding patient characteristics, depth of anaesthesia, sufentanil total dose, anaesthesia duration (D: 349.1 +/- 19.1 min; I: 349.2 +/- 22.9 min), haemodynamic/respiratory parameters, and surgical conditions (assessed by a bleeding score). The emergence time in the D group was significantly faster than the I group (D: 14.9 +/- 2.4 min vs I: 29.2 +/- 2.4 min for eye-opening). Full recovery also occurred earlier in the D group (D: 22.1 +/- 3.1 min vs I: 37.6 +/- 4.0 min, P<0.005 for stating name). Steward recovery scores were also better during the first postoperative hour in the D group (D: 40 min vs I: 90 min, P<0.005 for 100% of patients with Steward score of 6). The results indicate that desflurane is associated with similar operating conditions and faster postoperative recovery following acoustic neuroma surgery. The faster recovery following desflurane may be desirable after long surgical procedures, enabling the patient's full cooperation and facilitating early diagnosis of any potential neurological deficit.
