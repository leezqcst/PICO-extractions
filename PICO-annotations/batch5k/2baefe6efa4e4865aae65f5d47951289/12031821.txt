Improved fibrinolysis after 1-year treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with coronary heart disease.

The study was aimed to investigate the effect of two different statins on the levels of haemostatic variables reflecting procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with the hypothesis that statins might beneficially modify these levels. Fifty-eight patients were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin (n=28) or simvastatin (n=30) for 1 year. The starting dose in both groups was 20 mg/day. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after 12-month treatment for determinations of fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), plasma D-dimer, soluble tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, tPA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity (PAI-1 activity) and serum D-dimer as a global test of fibrinolytic activity. In the total population, improved fibrinolytic activity was observed after 1 year with increased levels of serum D-dimer (P=.001) and tPA activity (P=.024) and a reduction in tPA antigen (P=.048). No statistically significant changes were observed in any of the measured coagulation variables. Separately examined, an improved fibrinolytic profile was seen in the atorvastatin group with a significant increase in serum D-dimer (P=.005), a borderline increase in tPA activity (P=.083) and a borderline reduction in tPA antigen (P=.069). Within the simvastatin group, a reduction in prothrombin F1+2 was observed (P=.038). The differences in changes between the groups were statistically significant only for global fibrinolysis (serum D-dimer, P=.046). In conclusion, an improved fibrinolytic profile was observed after statin treatment, most pronounced with atorvastatin. The results indicate that the drugs promote a profibrinolytic profile, and may in part explain the benefit of statin treatment rendered in the prevention of CHD.
