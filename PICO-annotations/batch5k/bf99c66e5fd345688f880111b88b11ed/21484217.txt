Influence of two different flap designs on the sequelae of mandibular third molar surgery.

PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare the influence of triangular and envelope flaps on trismus, pain, and facial swelling after mandibular third molar surgery.
METHODS Twenty healthy patients with bilateral, symmetrically impacted mandibular third molars were included in this double-blinded, prospective, cross-over, randomized study. The patients were operated with envelope flap on one side and triangular flap on the other side. Trismus was determined by measuring maximum interincisal opening, and facial swelling was evaluated using a tape measuring method. Pain was determined using visual analog scale (VAS) and recording the number of pain pills taken.
RESULTS The facial swelling measurements and VAS scores were lower in the envelope flap group compared to the triangular flap group. There was no significant difference between the two flap designs in operation time, maximum interincisal opening, and the number of analgesics taken.
CONCLUSION Envelope flap yields to less facial swelling and reduced VAS scores in comparison to triangular flap. There is no clinical difference in trismus between the two flap designs. Despite the higher VAS scores with triangular flap, no additional doses of analgesics were required in triangular flap.
