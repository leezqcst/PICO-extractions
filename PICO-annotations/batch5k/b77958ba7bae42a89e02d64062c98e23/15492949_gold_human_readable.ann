a randomized double-blind trial of gemfibrozil versus placebo in 2,531 men with coronary disease, HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or less (< or =1.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 140 mg/dL or less (< or =3.6 mmol/L), and a range of triglyceride values.

RESULTS Change in renal function could be calculated in 1,981 individuals, of whom 399 individuals (20.2%) were eligible for inclusion.
Participants 1495 1768 3
Among 399 study subjects, the rate of change in renal function in the gemfibrozil group during a median of 61 months was not significantly different from that in the placebo group (0.49 mL/min/1.73 m2/y faster; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 slower to 1.09 faster; P = 0.10)
