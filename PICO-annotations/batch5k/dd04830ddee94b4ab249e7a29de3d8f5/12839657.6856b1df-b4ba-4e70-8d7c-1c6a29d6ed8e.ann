T1	Participants 37 165	potassium and calcium supplementation on arterial blood pressure and sodium metabolism in adolescents with higher blood pressure

T3	Participants 684 773	10 mmol of potassium and 10 mmol of calcium mixed in their table salt daily for 24 months
T4	Participants 783 937	Night urinary sodium and potassium excretion increased (urinary Na(+), P < 0.05; urinary K(+), P < 0.01) and blood pressure lowered by 5.3 mm Hg/1.8 mm Hg
T5	Participants 1157 1345	potassium and calcium in daily table salt intake was an effective way to prevent form hypertension and could promote their urinary sodium excretion and reduction of arterial blood pressure
