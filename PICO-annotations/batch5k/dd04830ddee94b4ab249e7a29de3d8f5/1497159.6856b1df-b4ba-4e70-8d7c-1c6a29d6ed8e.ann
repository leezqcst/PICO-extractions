T1	Participants 51 128	prevention of fasciculations with pancuronium versus minidose succinylcholine
T2	Participants 204 262	increased intracranial pressure and emesis with aspiration
T3	Participants 391 598	Prevention of fasciculations during rapid-sequence intubation of head trauma patients can be accomplished as safely and effectively with minidose succinylcholine as with a defasciculating dose of pancuronium
T4	Participants 662 733	An inner-city county trauma center with 70,000 patient visits per year.
T5	Participants 1332 1463	46 patients, eight of 19 (42%) in the pancuronium group and six of 27 (22%) in the succinylcholine group experienced fasciculations
T6	Participants 1670 1743	No patient in either group experienced emesis or significant dysrhythmias
T7	Participants 1774 1931	minidose succinylcholine causes no greater incidence of fasciculations than pancuronium in rapid-sequence intubation of head trauma patients in an ED setting
T8	Participants 1073 1194	Patients were randomized to receive either minidose succinylcholine (0.1 mg/kg) or pancuronium (0.03 mg/kg) IV one minute
