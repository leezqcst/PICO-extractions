head trauma patients

Prevention of fasciculations during rapid-sequence intubation of head trauma patients can be accomplished as safely and effectively with minidose succinylcholine as with a defasciculating dose of pancuronium
Participants 662 733 3
An inner-city county trauma center with 70,000 patient visits per year.
Participants 747 884 6
Sequential adult head trauma patients requiring rapid-sequence intubation who had no contraindications to succinylcholine or pancuronium.
Participants 899 1262 4
Each head trauma patient requiring rapid-sequence intubation who met the inclusion criteria received standard rapid-sequence intubation maneuvers and lidocaine (1 mg/kg) IV. Patients were randomized to receive either minidose succinylcholine (0.1 mg/kg) or pancuronium (0.03 mg/kg) IV one minute prior to the full paralytic dose of succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) IV.
Participants 1332 1463 4
46 patients, eight of 19 (42%) in the pancuronium group and six of 27 (22%) in the succinylcholine group experienced fasciculations
Participants 1774 1931 3
minidose succinylcholine causes no greater incidence of fasciculations than pancuronium in rapid-sequence intubation of head trauma patients in an ED setting
