GH effect on enzyme activity of 11betaHSD in abdominal obesity is dependent on treatment duration.

OBJECTIVE In the past years the interaction of GH and 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11betaHSD) in the pathogenesis of central obesity has been suggested.
DESIGN We studied the effects of 9 months of GH treatment on 11betaHSD activity and its relationship with body composition and insulin sensitivity in 30 men with abdominal obesity, aged 48-66 years, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
METHODS Urinary steroid profile was used to estimate 11betaHSD type 1 and 2 (11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2) activities. Abdominal s.c. and visceral adipose tissues were measured using computed tomography. Glucose disposal rate (GDR) obtained during a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp was used to assess insulin sensitivity.
RESULTS In the GH-treated group the 11betaHSD1 activity decreased transiently after 6 weeks (P < 0.01) whereas 11betaHSD2 increased after 9 months of treatment (P < 0.05). Between 6 weeks and 9 months, GDR increased and visceral fat mass decreased. Changes in 11betaHSD1 correlated with changes in visceral fat mass between baseline and 6 weeks. There were no significant correlations between 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD 2 and changes in GDR.
DISCUSSION The study demonstrates that short- and long-term GH treatment has different effects on 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity. Moreover, the data do not support that long-term metabolic effects of GH are mediated through its action on 11betaHSD.
