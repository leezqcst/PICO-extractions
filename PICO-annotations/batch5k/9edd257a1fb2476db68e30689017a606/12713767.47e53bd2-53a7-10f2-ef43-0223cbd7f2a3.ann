T1	Participants 0 90	Effects of ezetimibe, a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor, on plasma lipids in patients
T2	Participants 96 124	primary hypercholesterolemia
T3	Participants 251 272	10 mg/day in patients
T4	Participants 361 453	a 2-12-week washout period, and a 4-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, 827 patients
T5	Participants 740 805	efficacy endpoint was percentage reduction in direct plasma LDL-C
T6	Participants 941 1017	Response to ezetimibe was generally consistent across all subgroups analyzed
T7	Participants 1034 1224	significantly improved levels of plasma total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, high-density lipoprotein(2)-cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), and elicited a trend toward lower triglyceride levels
T8	Participants 1461 1639	Ezetimibe, which significantly reduces LDL-C and favorably affects other lipid variables, may provide a well tolerated and effective new option for lipid management in the future
T9	Participants 1278 1367	lipid-soluble vitamins or significantly affect baseline or stimulated cortisol production
