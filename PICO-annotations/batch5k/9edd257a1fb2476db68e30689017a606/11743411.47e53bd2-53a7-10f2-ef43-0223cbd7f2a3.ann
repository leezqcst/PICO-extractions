T1	Participants 0 83	Capsular contracture around saline-filled fine textured and smooth mammary implants
T2	Participants 99 117	7.5-year follow-up
T3	Participants 268 303	large pore size (300 to 600 microm)
T4	Participants 433 502	smooth and textured saline-filled prostheses with pores of small size
T5	Participants 523 633	7.5 years, the breast hardness was followed up, and at the end of the study patient satisfaction was evaluated
T6	Participants 635 724	Twenty healthy women with a mean age of 30 years were operated on for breast augmentation
T7	Participants 872 969	a pore size of 30 to 70 microm in one breast, and a smooth saline-filled prosthesis in the other.
T8	Participants 970 1085	The hardness of the breasts was evaluated after 0.5, 1, and 7.5 years using Baker grading and applanation tonometry
T9	Participants 1087 1144	Eighteen patients completed 1-year and 7.5-year follow-up
T10	Participants 1197 1211	after 6 months
T11	Participants 1235 1341	r 1 year, four patients with smooth prostheses and one with a textured prosthesis had capsular contracture
T12	Participants 1354 1467	Seven and one-half years after surgery, six patents with smooth and four with textured implants had contracture (
T13	Participants 1584 1624	implant hardened between 6 and 12 months
T14	Participants 1634 1703	1 year and 7.5 years, three breasts with smooth and textured implants
T15	Participants 1886 2046	Four patients preferred the breast with the smooth prosthesis, three preferred the breast with the textured prosthesis, and the others found both breasts equal.
T16	Participants 2065 2147	no significant difference of contracture with smooth versus fine textured implants
T17	Participants 2149 2208	The majority of the patients preferred the smooth implants.
T18	Participants 2209 2317	The patients reported that the breast augmentation had had an extremely high impact on their quality of life
