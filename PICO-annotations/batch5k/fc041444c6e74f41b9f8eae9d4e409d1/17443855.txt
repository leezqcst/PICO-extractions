Long-term results of a randomized clinical trial of Shouldice, Lichtenstein and transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repairs.

INTRODUCTION There is an ongoing debate about the preferred technique for inguinal hernia repair. In this randomized study the long-term results of Shouldice, Lichtenstein and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair were compared.
METHODS Some 280 men with a primary hernia were randomized prospectively to undergo Shouldice, tension-free Lichtenstein or laparoscopic TAPP repair. Patients were examined after 52 months to assess hernia recurrence, nerve damage, testicular atrophy and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS Hernia recurrence occurred in six patients after Shouldice repair, and in one patient each after Lichtenstein and TAPP repairs. All recurrences after tension-free repairs were diagnosed within the first year after surgery. Nerve injuries were significantly more frequent after open Shouldice and Lichtenstein repairs. Patient satisfaction was greatest after laparoscopic TAPP repair.
CONCLUSION Tension-free repair was superior to the non-mesh Shouldice technique. The open anterior approach to the groin was associated with demonstrable nerve injury, and laparoscopic TAPP repair was the most effective approach in the hands of an experienced surgeon.
