Clinical Study to Assess the Stain Removal Effectiveness of a Tooth Whitening Regimen with Added Whitening Booster.

OBJECTIVE This randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the extrinsic stain reduction achieved by brushing with a whitening dentifrice and powered toothbrush, and to determine whether the addition of a whitening booster paste to this regimen would enhance its stain reducing effectiveness.
METHODS Sixty qualifying subjects were randomly assigned either to Regimen One, a whitening dentifrice (Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant [TR] toothpaste] and powered toothbrush (Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant [TR] Extra Whitening Spinbrush); Regimen Two, the dentifrice and powered toothbrush with the addition of a whitening booster; or Regimen Three, a negative control (Colgate Cavity Protection toothpaste and an ADA standard manual brush). They were instructed in the use of their assigned products and then brushed unsupervised at home for two minutes, twice daily, for 14 days. Extrinsic tooth stain was assessed at baseline and after two, five, and 14 days using a Modified Lobene Stain Index (MLSI) with Lobene inclusion criteria of â‰¥ 1.5.
RESULTS All three treatment groups had statistically significant (p < 0.0001) mean total MLSI reductions from baseline at each time point, in a time-dependent manner. Day 14 reductions were 22.2% for Colgate Cavity Protection, 29.1% for Regimen One, and 34.4% for Regimen Two. Reductions for Regimen One and Regimen Two were significantly greater compared to Regimen Three, the negative control, at each time period (p < 0.01), and those for Regimen Two were significantly greater compared to Regimen One on days 2 and 14 (p < 0.05) and directionally more effective on day 5 (p = 0.0673).
CONCLUSION The combination of Truly Radiant toothpaste and Truly Radiant Spinbrush provides safe and effective stain removal that can be further enhanced by the addition of the whitening booster.
