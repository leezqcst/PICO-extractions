T1	Participants 429 935	Fifty-nine healthy, low-active (exercise <60 min/week), overweight (body mass index 25.0-39.9) adults (18-65) received a 6-month print-based exercise promotion program with the goal of walking 30-60 min/day. Participants were surreptitiously randomly assigned to receive a recommendation for either self-paced (n = 30) or moderate (64-76 % maximum heart rate; n = 29) intensity exercise. All participants used electronic diaries and heart rate monitors to track exercise frequency, duration, and intensity.
