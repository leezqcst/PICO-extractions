The FLT3ITD mRNA level has a high prognostic impact in NPM1 mutated, but not in NPM1 unmutated, AML with a normal karyotype.

The impact of a FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) on prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is dependent on the ratio of mutated to wild-type allele. In 648 normal karyotype (NK) AML patients, we found a significant independent effect of the quantitative FLT3ITD mRNA level--measured as (FLT3ITD/wtFLT3)/(FLT3ITD/wtFLT3+1)--on outcome. Moreover, this effect was clearly seen in 329 patients with a mutated NPM1 gene (NPM1+), but not in 319 patients without a NPM1 mutation (wtNPM1). In a multivariate Cox regression model, the quantitative FLT3ITD mRNA level showed an independent prognostic impact on overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) only in the NPM1+ subgroup (OS: hazard ratio, 5.9; [95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1-11.2]; RFS: hazard ratio, 7.5 [95% CI: 3.4-16.5]). The FLT3ITD mRNA level contributes to relapse risk stratification and might help to guide postremission therapy in NPM1-mutated AML.
