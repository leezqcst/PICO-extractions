S In patients with mainly pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome, using high mean airway pressure under high-frequency oscillatory ventilation can worsen right ventricular function when compared with protective conventional mechanical ventilation, notably in patients in whom high-frequency oscillatory ventilation produced less alveolar recruitment of the posterior parts of the lun
