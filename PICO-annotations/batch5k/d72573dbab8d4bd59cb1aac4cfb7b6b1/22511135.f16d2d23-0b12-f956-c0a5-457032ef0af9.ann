T1	Participants 0 123	Right ventricular function during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome
T2	Participants 152 257	effect of mean airway pressure under high-frequency oscillatory ventilation on right ventricular function
T3	Participants 327 351	a tertiary care hospital
T4	Participants 362 470	Sixteen consecutive patients within the first 48 hrs of mainly pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome
T5	Participants 1031 1110	Right ventricular function was assessed using transesophageal echocardiography.
T6	Participants 1942 2049	High-frequency oscillatory ventilation did not improve oxygenation whatever the mean airway pressure level.
T7	Participants 2149 2231	electrical impedance tomography measurements when increasing mean airway pressure.
T8	Participants 2492 2882	In patients with mainly pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome, using high mean airway pressure under high-frequency oscillatory ventilation can worsen right ventricular function when compared with protective conventional mechanical ventilation, notably in patients in whom high-frequency oscillatory ventilation produced less alveolar recruitment of the posterior parts of the lungs
T9	Participants 2906 3006	the interest of monitoring right ventricular function during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
