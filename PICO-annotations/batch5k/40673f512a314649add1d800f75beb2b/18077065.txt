Mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique after 7 weeks of low-intensity wheelchair training.

BACKGROUND To evaluate the effect of a 7-week low-intensity hand rim wheelchair training on the submaximal metabolic cost, mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique in able-bodied participants.
METHODS Participants were randomly divided over an experimental group (n=14) and a control group (n=7). The experimental group received 7 weeks wheelchair training (3 week(-1), 70 min) at a low intensity (30% of the heart rate reserve), whereas the control group did not receive training. During pre- and post-tests, submaximal exercise was performed on a stationary wheelchair ergometer at fixed levels of power output. Mechanical efficiency, oxygen uptake, heart rate, timing parameters and stroke angles were measured. Video recordings were made to determine the stroke pattern.
FINDINGS Mechanical efficiency increased and metabolic cost decreased significantly in the experimental group compared to the control group. Push time increased and cycle frequency decreased as a result of training. The stroke angle increased in the experimental group during the training period. The experimental group preferred double-looping over propulsion, while the control group mainly used single-looping over propulsion patterns during the post-test.
INTERPRETATION A low-intensity, 7-week training protocol has a beneficial effect on the mechanical efficiency and metabolic cost of wheelchair propulsion in able-bodied participants. The improved mechanical efficiency seems to be the result of changes in propulsion technique that were found.
