Antihypertensive and volume-depleting effects of mild exercise on essential hypertension.

After a general clinical observation period of over 4 weeks, 20 essential hypertensive subjects (Japanese) were randomly divided into two groups. One group (n = 10; 4 men and 6 women; 51.4 +/- 2.8 years of age) agreed to physical training using bicycle ergometer exercise with the intensity at blood lactate threshold for 60 minutes three times a week for 10 weeks, while the other group (n = 10; 4 men and 6 women; 51.0 +/- 2.9 years of age) did no particular physical training and was followed once a week as the control. Changes in blood pressure, hemodynamics, and humoral factors of the exercised group were compared with values in the controls. The following significant changes were found only in the exercised group. Blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced. Whole blood and plasma volume indices were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, respectively). The change in ratio of serum sodium to potassium positively correlated with the change in systolic blood pressure (r = 0.76, p less than 0.02). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations both at rest and at the workload of blood lactate threshold during graded exercise tests were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.02 respectively) after 10 weeks of exercise training. The change in the resting level of plasma norepinephrine positively correlated with that in the mean blood pressure. No such changes were observed in the control group. In both groups, body weight and urinary sodium excretion showed no statistically significant changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
