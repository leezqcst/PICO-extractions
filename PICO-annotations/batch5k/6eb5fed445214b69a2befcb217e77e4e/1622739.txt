Clinical trials of intrasplenic arterial infusion of interleukin-2 (IS-IL-2) to patients with advanced cancer.

We tried a infusion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) of a relatively low dose via an intrasplenic arterial catheter connected to a chronometric infusion (IS-IL-2). Eighteen patients of colorectal cancer with metastases to the liver or lung or of unresectable hepatoma received a 24 hour continuous infusion with low dose recombinant of IL-2 (mainly 8 x 10(5) JRU/day) for 25-40 days. All patients tolerated this protocol of the therapy and the main toxic effects were fever and general fatigue. Such serious toxicity as previously reported by high dose IL-2 therapy was not observed. Data of hepatic and renal functions were normal. IS-IL-2 therapy induced a high incidence of eosinophilia (12/18) and thrombocythemia (12/18). Peripheral natural killer (NK) and LAK activities were augmented in all patients and total white blood cell counts were increased during IS-IL-2 therapy. An increase in IL-2 receptor expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and significant rises in numbers of Leu11 (CD16)+, OKM1(CD11)+ and OKIa1(HLA-DR)+ were observed. Of 18 patients 12 were evaluable for their response to therapy. Partial response (PR) was observed in one unresectable hepatoma and 11 demonstrated no change (NC) or progressive disease (PD). Six patients were not evaluable because of additional therapy (3 cases) or decreasing tumor cell markers having no measurable lesions (3 cases). Three patients of colorectal cancer from an unresectable group were presumed to have micrometastases to the liver as suggested by an elevated serum CEA level. After receiving IS-IL-2 therapy they demonstrated a decrease in the serum CEA level for more than 3 years after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
