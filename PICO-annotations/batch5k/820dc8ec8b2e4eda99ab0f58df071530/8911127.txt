The impact of a psychological intervention on quality of life in non-metastatic breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to determine whether psychological intervention had a beneficial effect on the quality of life and behaviour of women diagnosed with breast cancer. 36 consecutive patients with non-metastatic breast cancer assigned to surgery and systemic chemotherapy were randomised to receive either psychological intervention (weekly cognitive individual psychotherapy and bimonthly family counselling) or standard follow-up. Personality (16-PF and IIQ), quality of life (FLIC), and depression (BDI) scores were the endpoints for this study, and the questionnaires were completed by the patients at diagnosis, and up to 9 months after diagnosis. Cognitive psychotherapy and family counselling improved both depression and quality of life indexes compared with the control group. Better emotional coping behaviours were also revealed by some changes in personality traits in the intervention group.
