T1	Participants 83 198	This study investigates the role of oral sildenafil in decreasing pulmonary pressure after congenital heart surgery
T2	Participants 589 716	These patients were compared to a group of 22 children with similar pathologies who did not receive sildenafil (control group).
T3	Participants 1048 1184	There was no significant rise in PA pressure following discontinuation of the drug (26.30 +/- 6.66 vs 28.49 +/- 10.93 mm Hg, p = 0.366).
T4	Participants 200 587	Between September 2002 and September 2004, among a group of postoperative children with large septal defects, moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension [pulmonary artery (PA) to aortic (Ao) pressure ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.17] and systemic desaturation (Ao Sat = 0.89 +/- 0.11), oral sildenafil (0.3 mg x kg(-1), every 3 hours) was administered for a period of 24-48 hours (sildenafil group)
