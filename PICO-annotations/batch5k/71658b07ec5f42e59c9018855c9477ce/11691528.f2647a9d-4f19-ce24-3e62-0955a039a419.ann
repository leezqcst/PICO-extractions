T1	Participants 1521 1617	CONCLUSIONS There is a strong association between non-accidental falls and cardioinhibitory CSH.
T2	Participants 808 953	RESULTS One hundred seventy-five eligible patients (mean age 73 +/- 10 years; 60% women) were randomized to the trial: pacemaker 87; controls 88.
T3	Participants 456 623	METHODS A randomized controlled trial was done of consecutive older patients (>50 years) attending an accident and emergency facility because of a non-accidental fall.
T4	Participants 103 264	OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to determine whether cardiac pacing reduces falls in older adults with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH).
T5	Participants 276 371	Cardioinhibitory carotid sinus syndrome causes syncope, and symptoms respond to cardiac pacing.
