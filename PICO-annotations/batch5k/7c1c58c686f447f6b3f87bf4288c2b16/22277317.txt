Randomized comparison of the efficacy and safety of zotarolimus-eluting stents vs. sirolimus-eluting stents for percutaneous coronary intervention in chronic total occlusion--CAtholic Total Occlusion Study (CATOS) trial.

BACKGROUND Limited data are available regarding the direct comparison of angiographic and clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DESs) for chronic total occlusion (CTO).
METHODS AND RESULTS A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate the non-inferiority of a zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES; Endeavor Sprint®, n=80) to a sirolimus-eluting stent (SES; Cypher®, n=80) in patients with CTO lesion with a reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.5mm. The primary endpoint was in-segment binary restenosis rate at 9-month angiographic follow-up. Key secondary endpoints included target vessel failure (TVF; including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization) and Academic Research Consortium-defined definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) within 12 months. The ZES was non-inferior to the SES with respect to the primary endpoint, which occurred in 14.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0-22.2) and in 13.7% (95%CI: 5.8-21.6) of patients, respectively (non-inferiority margin, 15.0%; P for non-inferiority <0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of TVF (10.0% vs. 17.5%; P=0.168) nor in the rate of ST (0.0% vs. 1.3%; P=0.316) during the 12-month clinical follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness and safety of ZES are similar to those of SES and therefore it is a good treatment option in patients undergoing PCI for CTO with DESs.
