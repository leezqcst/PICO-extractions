Treatment of recurrent chronic hyperplastic sinusitis with nasal polyposis.

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the long-term efficacy of intranasal furosemide, an inhibitor of the sodium chloride cotransporter channel at the basolateral surface of the respiratory epithelial cell, vs no therapeutic intervention vs intranasal mometasone furoate, a corticosteroid, in preventing relapses of chronic hyperplastic sinusitis with nasal polyposis.
DESIGN Randomized prospective controlled study. Patients were examined every 6 months during follow-up (range, 1-9 years).
PATIENTS One hundred seventy patients with bilateral obstructive or minimally obstructive chronic hyperplastic sinusitis with nasal polyposis.
INTERVENTION All patients were surgically treated in the ENT Department, University of Siena Medical School. One month after surgery, group 1 patients (n = 97) started treatment with intranasal furosemide, group 2 (n = 40) received no therapeutic treatment, and group 3 (n = 33) were treated with mometasone.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical and instrumental evaluation of postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS Seventeen (17.5%) of 97 patients in group 1, 12 (30.0%) of 40 patients in group 2, and 8 (24.2%) of 33 patients in group 3 experienced nasal polyposis relapses. We noted a prevalence of early-stage relapse in patients treated with furosemide or mometasone, whereas patients who did not receive any treatment experienced more severe grades of chronic hyperplastic sinusitis with nasal polyposis (P<.005).
CONCLUSION Use of intranasal furosemide represents a valid therapeutic treatment in the prevention of chronic hyperplastic sinusitis with nasal polyposis.
