The effect of splinting of teeth in combination with reconstructive periodontal surgery in humans.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of splinting teeth on the results of periodontal reconstructive surgery using a specific carbonate bone replacement graft (BRG) material. Forty-five patients were randomly treated with a periodontal surgery approach. Natural coral calcium BRG was utilised in 33 patients. This 33-patient group was divided into three equal groups. In the presplint group, teeth were splinted to at least two rigid teeth before surgery, in the postsplint group, teeth were splinted at suture removal, and in the nonsplint group, the treated teeth were not splinted at all. In 12 patients, teeth were treated with surgical debridement (DEBR) alone and not splinted. Periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical probing attachment level (CPAL), and tooth mobility were measured using desmodontometry (DDM) and periotest (PTV) with reproducible methods before surgery and at various periods up to 1 year afterwards. A decrease in PPD (5.4 mm, SD 1.4 mm) and tooth mobility (DDM-horizontal 257 microns, SD 60 microns) and a gain of CPAL (5.1 mm, SD 1.4 mm) were seen following the use of BRG in presplint teeth. In the same group, PPD and tooth mobility were significantly reduced compared to nonsplint teeth. DEBR alone showed reductions in tooth mobility and PPD and a significantly smaller gain in CPAL than in presplint teeth treated with BRG. The less favourable improvement in periodontal function of postsplint or nonsplint teeth seemed to be due to the loss of BRG material caused by tooth mobility. These results indicate that an undisturbed wound healing process using BRG together with tooth stability is beneficial to overall clinical success.
