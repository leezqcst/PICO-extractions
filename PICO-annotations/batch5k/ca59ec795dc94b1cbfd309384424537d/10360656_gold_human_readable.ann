with or without human interferon-beta, for advanced colorectal cancer

This study compared the efficacy and safety of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) monotherapy to that of 5-FU combined with natural human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) in patients with unresectable, advanced colorectal carcinoma.
Participants 333 827 8
Forty-nine chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized to 5-FU alone or to the combination. All patients received 750 mg m(-2) day(-1) 5-FU for 5 days by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion, followed after day 15 by a weekly i.v. bolus of 750 mg m(-2). IFN-beta was injected intramuscularly three times weekly at 9 M IU. Treatment continued for 52 weeks, or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Clinical endpoints were tumor response, time to progression, survival and toxicity
