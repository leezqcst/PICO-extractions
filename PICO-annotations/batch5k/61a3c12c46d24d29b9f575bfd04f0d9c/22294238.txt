Predictors of response to ziprasidone: results from a 6-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for acute depressive mixed state.

INTRODUCTION The present study is aimed at investigating possible predictors of response to ziprasidone in a sample of patients with mixed depressive state.
METHODS 72 patients were randomized to either ziprasidone or placebo and treated prospectively for 6 weeks. The clinical response and remission were defined with various clinical variables including Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Further outcome measures included predictors of remission and other clinical variables over time.
RESULTS None of the variables under investigation were significantly associated with response or remission at 6 weeks (all p-values>0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS Further investigations are warranted due to clear limitations, mostly small sample size and use of concomitant medications.
