T1	Participants 1384 1530	CONCLUSIONS The increased VM H-reflex amplitude at 3 months following HS autograft ACLR demonstrates an increase in VM neuromuscular excitability.
T2	Participants 870 944	METHODS Preoperatively bilateral VM and SOL H-reflex tests were conducted.
T3	Participants 112 244	PURPOSE Quadriceps weakness following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is prevalent despite intensive rehabilitation
T4	Participants 1149 1262	RESULTS The VM H-reflex amplitude increased in the HS group at 3 months compared to 1-month post surgery (p<.05).
