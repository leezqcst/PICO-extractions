Skin improvement with two different oestroprogestins in patients affected by acne and polycystic ovary syndrome: clinical and instrumental evaluation.

BACKGROUND Despite it is accepted that acne is mostly caused by an hyper-responsiveness of the pilo-sebaceous unit to normal circulating androgen hormones, in a few patients, especially women, acneic lesions can be associated with increased serum androgen levels (hyperandrogenism), of which polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause. In women with acne and proven PCOS therapy with estroprogestins (EPs) can be an excellent option.
OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to assess the effects of two estroprogestins (EPs), ethinyl-estradiol (EE) 30 mcg/drospirenone (DRSP) 3 mg, and ethinyl-estradiol (EE) 30 mcg/chlormadinone acetate (CMA) 2 mg, both on increased serum androgen levels and on several skin parameters in women affected by mild to severe acne and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS Fifty-nine women were randomized to receive EE/DRSP (n = 32) or EE/CMA (n = 27) for six months. Evaluation of serum androgen levels, grading of acne and hirsutism (respectively with Pillsbury and Ferriman-Gallwey score) and non-invasive assessment of skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin homogeneity were performed at baseline, at 3 and 6 months (end of treatment).
RESULTS Both treatments were well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of skin and hormonal parameters, although EE/DRSP showed a more potent effect on acne and seborrhea.
CONCLUSIONS Estroprogestins represent an effective and safe treatment in women with acne and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Nevertheless, the combination EE 30 mcg/DRSP 3 mg appears to be a more potent therapeutic option.
