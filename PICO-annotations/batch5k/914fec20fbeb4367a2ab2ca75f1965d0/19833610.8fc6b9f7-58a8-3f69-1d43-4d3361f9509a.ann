T1	Participants 1512 1609	CONCLUSION The results indicate that intracoronary mBMC treatment in AMI is safe in the long term
T2	Participants 1007 1084	RESULTS The rates of adverse clinical events in the groups were low and equal
T3	Participants 166 339	OBJECTIVE To investigate long-term safety and efficacy after intracoronary injection of autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells (mBMCs) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
T4	Participants 428 579	PATIENTS Patients from the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation in Acute Myocardial Infarction (ASTAMI) study were re-assessed 3 years after inclusion.
T5	Participants 580 806	INTERVENTIONS 100 patients with anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomised to receive intracoronary injection of mBMCs (n = 50) or not (n = 50).
