Beta radiation as an adjunct to low-risk trabeculectomy.

PURPOSE To assess a single dose of intraoperative beta radiation used to enhance the success rate of trabeculectomy in a population of low-risk glaucoma patients in whom antimetabolites might not be indicated.
METHODS A prospective randomized trial of 65 eyes was designed, with 31 eyes receiving 750 rads of intraoperative beta radiation (group 1), and 34 eyes receiving no supplementation (group 2).
RESULTS Mean follow-up time was 24 months. Mean postoperative intraocular pressure was 12.2 mmHg in group 1, and 13.7 mmHg in group 2 (P = 0.16). Mean decrease in intraocular pressure was 10.3 mmHg in group 1, and 9.3 mmHg in group 2 (P = 0.49). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of surgical complications.
CONCLUSION For this population of low-risk patients, there was no significant difference in outcome after applications of a single intraoperative dose of beta radiation.
