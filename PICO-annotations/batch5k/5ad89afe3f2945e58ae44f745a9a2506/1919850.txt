Effects of propranolol on bone metabolism in the rat.

Propranolol, a nonspecific beta-blocker has many physiologic effects. Its effects on bone in vivo are unknown, although beta receptor sites have been found on osteoblasts. In this study, the hypothesis tested was that low doses of propranolol could alter bone properties and enhance orthotopic endochondral bone formation. In a group of nonsurgical rats, propranolol treatment increased femoral torsional strength on biomechanical testing. In the rat surgical model used, right femora were fixed to a polyethylene plate and then defects were created mid-diaphysis and subsequently filled with demineralized bone matrix. These rats (defect rats) were randomly divided into groups that were given propranolol or a saline carrier for 19 consecutive days. In the defect rats, increased trabecular femoral metaphyseal mineral apposition rates were observed in propranolol-treated groups. Densitometry and roentgenographic scoring of callus formation after 12 weeks in propranolol-treated rats revealed increased callus and bone union. The results of this study indicate that propranolol treatment can significantly affect bone properties.
