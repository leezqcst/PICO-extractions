T1	Participants 966 1168	RESULTS Patients with high serum magnesium (defined as > or = 1.9 mEq/liter, n = 242) were less likely to survive than were patients with a normal magnesium level (n = 627) (p < 0.05, risk ratio = 1.41)
T2	Participants 1170 1360	Patients with a low magnesium level (defined as < or = 1.5 mEq/liter, n = 199) had no difference in survival compared with the group with a normal magnesium level (p = NS, risk ratio = 0.89)
