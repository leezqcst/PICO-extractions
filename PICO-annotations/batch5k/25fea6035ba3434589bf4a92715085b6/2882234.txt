Comparison of endotracheal and peripheral intravenous adrenaline in cardiac arrest. Is the endotracheal route reliable?

Twelve patients presenting to an accident and emergency department in asystolic cardiac arrest were randomly allocated to treatment with endotracheal adrenaline (five patients) or peripheral intravenous adrenaline (seven patients). Femoral-artery blood samples were taken for assay of adrenaline and noradrenaline. After intravenous adrenaline there was a good clinical and biochemical response, but after endotracheal adrenaline there was no change in serum adrenaline and no measurable clinical response. The endotracheal route of adrenaline administration is not reliable in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
