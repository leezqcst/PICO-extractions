The Effects of Valsartan and Amlodipine on the Levels of Irisin, Adropin, and Perilipin.

BACKGROUND Hypertension and obesity are two major threats for public health. Up to the present, antihypertensive medications have been used to lower blood pressure, which seem to provide a better life with lower morbidity and mortality rates. Their effect on etiopathogenesis of hypertension is now an area of developing research. The association between hypertension and obesity also suggests the link between antihypertensive agents and energy hemostasis. We aimed to investigate the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the irisin, adropin, and perilipin levels in patients with essential hypertension and to compare them with healthy volunteers in terms of their effect on energy hemostasis.
METHODS In total, 85 newly diagnosed patients with untreated essential hypertension were admitted to the outpatient clinic. Patients were randomized to one of the following treatment protocols: amlodipine or valsartan for a 12 week period. 42 patients were randomized into the valsartan group and 43 patients into the amlodipine group. Serum perilipin, irisin, and adropin levels were measured before and after drug treatment by ELISA kits.
RESULTS We discovered that the hypertensive patients have lower levels of perilipin and higher levels of adropin compared with the control group. Both amlodipine and valsartan increased the levels of perilipin, irisin, and adropin after 12 weeks of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, in regulating energy balance, perilipin, irisin, and adropin, could be of pathogenic importance in obesity-induced hypertension. Hence, ongoing trials need to elucidate this mechanism.
