Enalapril and lisinopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.

Hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg of enalapril (n = 50) or 10 mg of lisinopril (n = 47) daily. During a four-week titration period, the doses were increased weekly to a maximum of 40 mg once daily until the treatment goal of diastolic blood pressure (BP) of less than 90 mmHg was reached; treatment was then continued for four weeks. Systolic and diastolic BP declined significantly in the two treatment groups, from 147/98 mmHg in both the enalapril and lisinopril groups to 126/82 and 122/81 mmHg, respectively, at the end of treatment. During the first week of treatment, the goal of diastolic BP of less than 90 mmHg was reached by 40% of the enalapril group and 62% of the lisinopril group; by the end of the titration period, 98% and 96%, respectively, had achieved the BP goal. Few side effects were reported and there were no abnormal laboratory findings during treatment. It is concluded that once-daily administration of enalapril or lisinopril was generally effective and well-tolerated in the management of mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.
