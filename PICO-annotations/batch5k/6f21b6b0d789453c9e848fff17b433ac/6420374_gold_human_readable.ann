Ten undernourished patients receiving total parenteral nutrition and undergoing major intestinal surgery were restarted on intravenous feeds identical to their pre-operative regimens within 24 h of their operation. Five, chosen at random, received post-operatively 1-2 units insulin/kg body weight/24 h with their feed, while the other five received the feed only.
