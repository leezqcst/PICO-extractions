Participants 513 939 6
In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 2275 consecutive patients aged 18 years or older who were undergoing elective hip-replacement surgery to receive postoperative subcutaneous injections of either 2.5 mg fondaparinux once daily or 30 mg enoxaparin twice daily. The primary efficacy outcome was venous thromboembolism to day 11. The main safety outcomes were bleeding and death. Patients were followed up for 6 weeks.
