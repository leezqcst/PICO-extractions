T1	Participants 13 60	polyarteritis nodosa and Churg-Strauss syndrome
T2	Participants 62 93	indications of plasma exchanges
T3	Participants 258 280	including 236 patients
T4	Participants 419 480	plasma exchanges (PE) in the treatment of systemic vasculitis
T5	Participants 491 544	hepatitis B virus (HBV) related PAN require treatment
T6	Participants 576 599	71 patients (1981-1983)
T7	Participants 839 871	December 1983 and December 1988,
T8	Participants 923 998	t patients without HBV markers and the second at patients with HBV markers.
T9	Participants 1002 1033	78 patients without HBV markers
T10	Participants 1124 1159	33 patients with PAN related to HBV
T11	Participants 1470 1615	56 patients and addressed to severe PAN without HBV markers or CSS we have shown that PE did not improve the prognosis and control of the disease
T12	Participants 2077 2147	majority of patients within 2 to 3 months; half of them seroconverted.
T13	Participants 2313 2375	role of PE in the treatment of systemic necrotizing vasculitis
T14	Participants 2552 2641	presently no argument supporting systematic administration of PE at the time of diagnosis
T15	Participants 2377 2476	PE are obviously useful in PAN related to HBV where immune complex deposition has been demonstrated
