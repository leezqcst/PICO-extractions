A prospective, randomized study of 5-fluorouracil and filtration surgery.

Our study shows that use of a small dose of subconjunctival 5-FU provides significantly lower postoperative intraocular pressure than does no antimetabolite treatment. Morphology of the postoperative blebs suggests that increased filtration results in lower intraocular pressure in the 5-FU group. Corneal epithelial defects were as common with a low dose as with higher doses previously described.
