Aspirin-associated iron loss as an anticancer mechanism.

A consensus view has emerged favoring an anticancer effect of long-term aspirin use. Aspirin-induced loss of stored iron from chronic gastrointestinal bleeding is proposed as a mechanism underlying this beneficial effect. In iron depletion, less iron may be available for carcinogenesis through free-radical mediated mechanisms and for promotion of tumor growth. Low-dose aspirin increases gastrointestinal losses of transfused radiolabeled autologous red cells. Observational studies report lower serum ferritin values with regular aspirin use. A protective effect of induced iron reduction against cancer mortality has been confirmed in a recent trial (FeAST) with subjects randomized to iron reduction or observation. Serum ferritin reductions in the FeAST trial were within conventionally normal reference ranges and were quantitatively similar to ferritin reductions in observational studies in regular aspirin users. Delayed anticancer effects of aspirin are compatible with the proposed mechanism, as continual microbleeding has a gradual cumulative effect on stored iron.
