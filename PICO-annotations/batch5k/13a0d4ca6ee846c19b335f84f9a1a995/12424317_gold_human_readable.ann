Our visual system can link components of contours and segregate contours from complex backgrounds based on geometric grouping rules. This is an important intermediate step in object recognition. The substrate for contour integration may be based on contextual interactions and intrinsic horizontal connections seen in primary visual cortex (V1). We examined the perceptual rules governing contour saliency to determine whether the spatial extents of contextual interactions and horizontal connections match those mediating saliency. To quantify these rules, we used stimuli composed of randomly oriented nonoverlapping line segments. Salient contours within this complex background were formed by colinear alignment of nearby segments. Contour detectability was measured using a 2-interval-forced-choice design
