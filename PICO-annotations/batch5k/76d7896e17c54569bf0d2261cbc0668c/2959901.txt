Bronchodilator effect of fenoterol and ipratropium bromide in infants with acute wheezing: use of MDI with a spacer device.

Twenty-eight infants admitted to Exequiel Gonz√°lez Cortes Children's Hospital because of acute wheezing (AW) were randomly assigned to three study groups. Fenoterol (FNT), ipratropium bromide (IB), and placebo were administered respectively to children in the different groups by means of metered dose inhalers (MDI) with spacers, using doses of 3 puffs every hour, for 4 hours. The degree of bronchial obstruction was assessed clinically and scored with the single-blind method every hour prior to each treatment. The criterion of a bronchodilator effect was a significant decrease in the degree of bronchial obstruction at subsequent scorings. The scores of the three groups were compared using the Student's t test for matched samples. The same test was also applied to the independent samples for determining the superiority of one treatment, FNT or IB, over the other. The results indicated a significant decrease in the scores of the groups receiving FNT and IB (P less than 0.05); this did not occur in the group in which placebo was used. FNT produced a more rapid and sustained effect than IB (P less than 0.05). Significant bronchodilator effect was obtained in infants with AW when repeated doses of FNT or IB were administered with MDI and spacers. This effect was significantly greater in the group treated with FNT.
