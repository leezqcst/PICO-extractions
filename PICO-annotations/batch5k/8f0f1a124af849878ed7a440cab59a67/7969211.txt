Naltrexone, an opiate antagonist, fails to modify motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.

One month of adjunct treatment with naltrexone (100 mg/day) was compared with placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design in two groups of patients with Parkinson's disease. The first group was composed of 10 patients with a moderate motor impairment insufficiently controlled by monotherapy with bromocriptine. The second group was composed of eight patients with L-dopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia. Naltrexone as compared with placebo did not demonstrate any significant change in motor function in either group. These negative clinical results do not support a significant role of endogenous opioid systems in the pathophysiology of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease.
