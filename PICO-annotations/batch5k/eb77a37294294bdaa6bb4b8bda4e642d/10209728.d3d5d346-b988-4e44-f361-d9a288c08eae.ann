T1	Participants 1967 2087	CONCLUSION Oral brovincamine may retard further visual field deterioration in patients with NTG who have low-normal IOP.
T2	Participants 995 1142	RESULTS There were no differences between groups in age; sex distribution; refraction; blood pressure; baseline IOP; MD, CPSD, or TD at each point.
T3	Participants 373 596	METHODS Fifty-two patients with NTG (average age 57.7 years) with an IOP that was consistently less than 15 mmHg were randomly assigned to receive oral brovincamine (20 mg three times daily) or to an untreated control group
T4	Participants 132 372	PURPOSE To prospectively study the effect of oral brovincamine, a relatively selective cerebral vasodilator, on further deterioration of visual field in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) with low-normal intraocular pressure (IOP).
T5	Participants 0 129	Effects of oral brovincamine on visual field damage in patients with normal-tension glaucoma with low-normal intraocular pressure
