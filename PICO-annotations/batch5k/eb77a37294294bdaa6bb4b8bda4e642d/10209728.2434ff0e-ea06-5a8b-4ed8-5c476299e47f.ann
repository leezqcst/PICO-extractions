T1	Participants 381 994	Fifty-two patients with NTG (average age 57.7 years) with an IOP that was consistently less than 15 mmHg were randomly assigned to receive oral brovincamine (20 mg three times daily) or to an untreated control group. The groups were prospectively followed for 2 years with visual field examinations every 4 months, using the 30-2 Humphrey perimeter program. Changes in mean deviation (MD), corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD), and total deviation (TD) at 74 test points were analyzed using regression analysis with linear mixed model. Data from one eye without media opacity of each subject were analyzed.
