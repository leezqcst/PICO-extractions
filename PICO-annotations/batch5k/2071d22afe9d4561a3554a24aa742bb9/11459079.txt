Famotidine treatment of children with autistic spectrum disorders: pilot research using single subject research design.

Using single subject research design, we performed pilot research to evaluate the safety and efficacy of famotidine for the treatment of children with autistic spectrum disorders. We studied 9 Caucasian boys, 3.8-8.1 years old, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder, living with their families, receiving no chronic medications, and without significant gastrointestinal symptoms. The dose of oral famotidine was 2 mg/kg/day (given in two divided doses); the maximum total daily dose was 100 mg. Using single-subject research analysis and medication given in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 4 of 9 children randomized (44%) had evidence of behavioral improvement. Primary efficacy was based on data kept by primary caregivers, including a daily diary; daily visual analogue scales of affection, reciting, or aspects of social interaction; Aberrant Behavior Checklists (ABC, Aman); and Clinical Global Improvement scales. Children with marked stereotypy (meaningless, repetitive behaviors) did not respond. Our subjects did not have prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopy was not part of our protocol; thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that our subjects improved due to the effective treatment of asymptomatic esophagitis. The use of famotidine for the treatment of children with autistic spectrum disorders warrants further investigation.
