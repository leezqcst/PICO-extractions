T1	Participants 1807 2018	CONCLUSIONS In this study of anemic critically ill patients treated with epoetin alfa, all dosing regimens were well tolerated and appeared to effect reticulocytosis, with a peak at day 11 or 15 in most patients
T2	Participants 1133 1351	MAIN RESULTS Of the 60 patients who were enrolled (60% men, mean age 53 years, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 19.5), 30 were evaluable for both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (50%)
T3	Participants 497 656	PATIENTS Adult (age >or=18 years) critically ill patients with hemoglobin <or=12 g/dL, expected hospitalization of >or=7 days, with no ongoing acute blood loss
T4	Participants 135 387	OBJECTIVE To describe the pharmacokinetic profiles of six different dosing regimens for epoetin alfa, and whether more rapid and robust reticulocytosis can be elicited with more frequent administration of epoetin alfa in anemic critically ill patients.
T5	Participants 388 453	DESIGN Randomized, open-label, multicenter, 28-day clinical trial
