T1	Participants 1468 1596	It is concluded that some effects of low protein provision in utero can be alleviated by an adequate nutrient supply post-partum
T2	Participants 0 170	Low protein provision during the first year of life, but not during foetal life, affects metabolic traits, organ mass development and growth in male mink (Neovison vison)
T3	Participants 618 835	ighty-six male mink were exposed to low (19% of ME from CP; crude protein) or adequate (31% of ME from CP) protein provision in utero, and to LP (~20% of ME from CP) or AP (30-42% of ME from CP) provision post-weaning
T4	Participants 470 615	We investigated whether low protein provision in utero affects the long-term response to adequate (AP) or LP provision after weaning in male mink
