T3	Participants 181 488	The Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Heart Disease (LIPID) trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the long-term effect of pravastatin on coronary mortality in patients with a previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina-ischemic heart disease (IHD).
