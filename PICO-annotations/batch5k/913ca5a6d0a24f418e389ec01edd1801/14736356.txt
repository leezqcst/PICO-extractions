Single-needle acupuncture alleviates gag reflex during transesophageal echocardiography: a blinded, randomized, controlled pilot trial.

OBJECTIVES To study the effect of single-needle acupuncture in suppressing gag-reflex in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
DESIGN Prospective, blinded trial. Settings/locations: Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack undergoing TEE because of presumed cardioembolic origin in a specialized stroke unit of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. Subjects/Study interventions: Forty-one (41) patients were studied. Patients received single-needle acupuncture with a 0.2 x 13 mm disposable acupuncture needle (Suzhou Medical Appliances, China), 10-mm deep either at Chengjiang (midline between lower lip and chin) or superficially at a sham point (tip of the chin) during TEE or no acupuncture for alleviating gag reflex.
OUTCOME MEASURES Severity of gagging was rated on a visual-analogue scale.
RESULTS The acupuncture group experienced significantly less gagging than the sham group (p = 0.037) or the nonacupuncture group (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS Acupuncture of CV24 is an easy to apply and effective method to reduce gag reflex during TEE.
