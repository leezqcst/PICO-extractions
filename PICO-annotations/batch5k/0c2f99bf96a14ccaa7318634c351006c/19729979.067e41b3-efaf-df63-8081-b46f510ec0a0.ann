T1	Participants 1119 1253	CONCLUSIONS The weekly administration of docetaxel and gemcitabine did not result in superior clinical outcomes over weekly docetaxel.
T2	Participants 818 914	RESULTS The objective response rate was 18% and 27.5% in group A and B, respectively (p = 0.413)
T3	Participants 521 714	METHODS Patients were randomized to receive either weekly docetaxel 40 mg/m(2) (group A, n = 34) or the combination of weekly docetaxel 35 mg/m(2) with gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) (group B, n = 41)
T4	Participants 222 519	OBJECTIVE A randomized phase II trial was conducted to test whether the addition of gemcitabine to weekly docetaxel could improve the objective response rate and survival outcomes as second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed a paclitaxel-containing regimen
