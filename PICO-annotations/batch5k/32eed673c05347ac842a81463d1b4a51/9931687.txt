[Effect of alanyl-glutamine in postoperative total parenteral nutrition on postoperative immunosuppression and morbidity. Preliminary results of a prospective randomized study].

The impact of glutamine substitution on postoperative immunosuppression and morbidity was investigated in patients with surgical interventions and total parenteral nutrition in a prospective randomized trial. To analyze immune competence, the expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8 on lymphocytes and of HLA-DR and CD14 on monocytes as well as the plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 was evaluated before, 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after surgery. A total of 34 patients have been included (with glutamine: n = 18; without glutamine: n = 16). Patients with glutamine substitution showed decreased systemic inflammation, significant faster compensation for postoperative immunosuppression and a lower incidence of postoperative complications. Patients without postoperative complications showed no significant differences in postoperative immunosuppression.
