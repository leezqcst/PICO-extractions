T1	Participants 25 120	methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis increases exposure to methotrexate
T2	Participants 142 185	e the bioavailability of methotrexate (MTX)
T3	Participants 245 453	, to determine a possible pharmacokinetic explanation for the observation that combination treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with MTX and HCQ has been shown, clinically, to be more potent than MTX used alone.
T4	Participants 495 554	10 healthy subjects received, on each of 5 dosing occasions
T5	Participants 846 871	AUC for MTX was increased
T6	Participants 890 934	e maximum MTX concentration (Cmax) decreased
T7	Participants 1277 1417	the increased potency of the MTX-HCQ combination over MTX as a single agent and also the sustained effects of MTX when administered with HCQ
T8	Participants 1444 1547	Cmax of MTX observed during the coadministration may explain diminution of acute liver adverse effects.
T9	Participants 1654 1693	renal function is known to be decreased
T10	Participants 1620 1638	HCQ is recommended
