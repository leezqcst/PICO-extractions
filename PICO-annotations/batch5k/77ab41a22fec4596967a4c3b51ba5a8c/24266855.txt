The efficacy and safety of cyclosporine reduction in de novo renal allograft patients receiving sirolimus and corticosteroids: results from an open-label comparative study.

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a sirolimus, corticosteroid, and cyclosporine reduction regimen in an open-label, 12-month trial of 420 de novo renal allograft recipients at 49 European transplant centers. One month post-transplantation, 357 patients were randomized to receive standard-dose cyclosporine (sCsA, n = 179) or reduced-dose cyclosporine (rCsA, n = 178). All patients also received sirolimus and corticosteroids. The primary end points were the rate of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) and renal function, as measured by serum creatinine. Baseline demographic and donor characteristics were similar between groups. BCAR rates at 12 months were not significantly different: 11.2% for rCsA patients and 16.2% for sCsA patients. Mean serum creatinine (±SEM) was significantly lower (1.75 ± 0.10 vs. 1.97 ± 0.07 mg/dl, P < 0.001), and creatinine clearance (±SEM; Nankivell method) was significantly higher (57.8 ± 1.78 vs. 49.5 ± 2.46 ml/min, P < 0.001) in patients receiving rCsA versus sCsA at 1 year, respectively. Patient and graft survival exceeded 98% in both groups. No significant differences in infection or malignancy were noted between groups. The rCsA with sirolimus and corticosteroid regimen resulted in excellent 12-month patient and graft survival, a low incidence of BCAR, and improved renal function in renal allograft recipients. Sirolimus administered with rCsA and corticosteroids provided adequate immunosuppression while reducing the potential for the nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine. These findings may help to improve long-term renal allograft outcomes.
