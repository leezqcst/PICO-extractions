Budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate in hay fever - a single blind comparison.

93 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis took part in a single blind randomized clinical comparison of budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate (Becotide Nasal). All patients were sensitive to either birch or grass pollen, their sensitivity being confirmed by a skin prick test. The total daily dose was 400 micrograms for both drugs. Budesonide was administered twice a day and Becotide Nasal four times a day. Symptoms were assessed over a four-week period starting with a run-in period of one week. There was no placebo control group. Daily pollen counts were measured throughout the trial. The patients' diary cards revealed that both drugs had a beneficial therapeutic effect, and that budesonide was significantly more active than Becotide Nasal. The side effects of both drugs were few and transient.
