Satisfactory sampling in cytological cervical diagnosis: comparison between a conventional and a new sampling device.

AIM Inadequate cervical sampling is the most frequent cause of misdiagnosis in cervical cancer screening. The aim of this study was to test the ability of PapCone® versus the conventional sampling method (Ayre's spatula plus cytobrush) to collect ectocervical and glandular cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS In 18 healthy women, two ecto-endocervical samples, obtained by two different methods, were obtained at a three-month interval. Qualitative and quantitative parameters were evaluated. Ultrastructure features of sampling devices were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after sampling.
RESULTS The χ(2) test revealed a statistically significant difference between the two methods: PapCone® caused less cell overlap and sampled less white blood cells (p<0.05) and more metaplastic cells (p<0.01). SEM evaluation highlighted the porous and spongy structure of PapCone® that was responsible for the large number of glandular cells on its surface.
CONCLUSION Cervical smears performed by PapCone® were adequate and generally easier to screen than conventionally performed ones.
