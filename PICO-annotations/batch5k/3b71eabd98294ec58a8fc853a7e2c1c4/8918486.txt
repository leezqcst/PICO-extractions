Improved local control of invasive bladder cancer by concurrent cisplatin and preoperative or definitive radiation. The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.

PURPOSE A prospective randomized trial was conducted to determine whether the addition of concurrent cisplatin to preoperative or definitive radiation therapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer improved local control or survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Ninety-nine eligible patients with T2 to T4b transitional cell bladder cancer participated, 64% with cT3b or cT4. Patients and their physicians selected either definitive radiotherapy or precystectomy radiotherapy; patients were then randomly allocated to receive intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m2 at 2-week intervals for three cycles concurrent with pelvic radiation, or to receive radiation without chemotherapy. Patients were stratified by clinical tumor stage and by radiation plan. The median follow-up duration is 6.5 years.
RESULTS The occurrence of distant metastases was the same in both study arms. However, 25 of 48 control patients have had a first recurrence in the pelvis, compared with 15 of 51 cisplatin-treated patients (P = .036). The pelvic relapse rate in the two groups was significantly reduced by concurrent cisplatin (P = .038, log-rank test) and this effect was preserved in a stepwise Cox regression model of prognostic factors (hazards ratio, 0.50; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.86; P = .036). The hazard reduction was similar for both radiation plans. Pretreatment leukocytosis and high clinical stage were independent adverse factors in a Cox model of overall survival, but the effect of cisplatin was not significant.
CONCLUSION Concurrent cisplatin may improve pelvic control of locally advanced bladder cancer with preoperative or definitive radiation, but has not been shown to improve overall survival. The use of concurrent cisplatin had no detectable effect on distant metastases.
