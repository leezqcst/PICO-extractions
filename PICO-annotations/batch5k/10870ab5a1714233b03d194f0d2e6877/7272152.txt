Single and combined effects of atropine and metoclopramide on the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.

The effects of atropine and metoclopramide on the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (LOSP) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers using oesophageal pressure transducers. Atropine decreased LOSP significantly at 5 min after i.v. injection (P less than 0.005) and this change was sustained for 60 min. Metoclopramide increased LOSP significantly at 3 min after administration i.v. (P less than 0.05) and this change was sustained for 40 min. Following consecutive administration of the drugs the effects of atropine predominated.
