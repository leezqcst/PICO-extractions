Problem-based learning: is anatomy a casualty?

INTRODUCTION The teaching of medical anatomy is changing. Medical schools worldwide are moving away from dissection and lectures to a more integrated course, where basic science and clinical skills are taught simultaneously. Medical students on these integrated courses have reported a lack of confidence in their basic science knowledge, especially concerning anatomy. Our aim was to perform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare anatomical knowledge of two groups of second-year medical students, the first group taught on a traditional course, the second on an integrated course.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Testing was done using a Questionnaire in a "True/False" format. There were 80 students in each group. There was no penalty for an incorrect answer. The test was performed under examination conditions. Papers were marked under blind conditions. Results were analysed using a Student's t test analysis.
RESULTS Those students taught on a traditional course exhibited a significantly higher level of basic anatomical knowledge (p<0.001) than those taught on an integrated course. The students taught on an integrated course showed a much greater range of results.
CONCLUSIONS Students taught on a traditional course have a higher level of anatomical knowledge than those taught on an integrated course. Our results differ from previous studies done in Europe which show no difference between the courses.
