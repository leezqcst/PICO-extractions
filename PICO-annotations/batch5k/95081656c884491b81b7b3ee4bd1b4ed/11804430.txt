Improved responsiveness of PCOS patients to clomiphene after CYP17a inhibitor.

PURPOSE To study the effect of CYP17a inhibitor, "ketoconazole," on clomiphene responsiveness in PCOS patients.
METHODS Prospective analysis was employed with the setup at Alexandria IVF/ICSI center. Ninety-seven insulin-resistant PCOS patients undergoing ovulation induction using clomiphene citrate were randomly divided, by random number table, into two groups. The first group (n = 49) received ketoconazole (400 mg daily) till correction of metabolic syndrome followed by clomiphene (100 mg/day); the second group (n = 48) receiving clomiphene without ketoconazole pretreatment. Main outcome measures were incidence of clomiphene resistance, monofollicular response, fasting insulin/glucose ratio, serum testosterone, and pregnancy rates.
RESULTS The ketoconazole group showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher incidence of monofollicular response (38%), higher pregnancy rates, and significantly less marked antiestrogenic manifestations than did the control group. They also had significantly lower incidence of clomiphene resistance (11.6%), lower serum testosterone levels, less hyperinsulinaemia, than did the control group.
CONCLUSION Ketoconazole improved clomiphene responsivenss in PCOS patients and attenuated its untoward biological effects.
