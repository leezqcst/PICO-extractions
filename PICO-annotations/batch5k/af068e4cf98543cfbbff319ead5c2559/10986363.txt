Superior modulation of activation levels of stimulus representations does not underlie superior discrimination in autism.

The performance of children with and without autism was compared in object-based positive and negative priming tasks within a visual search procedure. Object-based positive and negative priming effects were found in both groups of children. This result provides the first evidence for the activation of object-based representations during visual search task performance and further supports the notion that both excitatory and inhibitory guidance mechanisms are involved in target location in visual search. The children with autism were overall better than the typically developing children at visual search, thus replicating demonstrations of superior discrimination in autism. Furthermore, there was no difference between the magnitude of the positive nor the negative priming effects of the groups. This finding suggests that excitatory and inhibitory control operate comparably in autism and normal development. These results are discussed in the light of the superior ability of individuals with autism to discriminate between items. More specifically, it is argued that superior discrimination in autism does not result from enhanced top-down excitatory and inhibitory control.
