T1	Participants 91 133	patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
T2	Participants 136 732	One hundred twenty-two chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma were entered into a randomized trial comparing infusional fluorouracil (FU) versus cisplatin (CDDP) and FU. In both groups, patients received continuous infusion FU 1,000 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Patients randomized to CDDP/FU also received CDDP 20 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) bolus on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. Patients were comparable in terms of age, performance status, baseline laboratory values, dominant sites of measurable disease, and percent of liver involvement
