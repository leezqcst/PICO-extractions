Anaerobic infection in cancer patients: comparative evaluation of clindamycin and cefoxitin.

Clindamycin and cefoxitin with or without gentamicin were administered to cancer patients having localized infections presumably caused by anaerobic pathogens. The rates of favorable response were 89% in patients receiving clindamycine alone and 78% in patients receiving cefoxitin alone. When the total experience is considered (clindamycin or cefoxitin with and without gentamicin), 20 of 24 patients (83%) responded to clindamycin and 18 of 22 (82%) responded to cefoxitin. Both therapies were well tolerated. Clindamycin was found to be more effective than cefoxitin in eradicating the offending anaerobic pathogens from the site of infection. Aerobic pathogens were frequently isolated along with anaerobes from the infectious sites in this series; their susceptibility or resistance to clindamycin or cefoxitin did not influence the therapeutic response.
