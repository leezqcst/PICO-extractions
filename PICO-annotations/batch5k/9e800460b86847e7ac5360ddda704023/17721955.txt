A 1.5-year follow-up of an Internet-based intervention for complicated grief.

Only recently have psychotherapeutic interventions for complicated grief been developed and evaluated in randomized controlled trials. These trials have reported significant reductions in complicated grief and related symptoms in response to treatment relative to control groups. However, little is known about the long-term outcomes of these treatments. The authors present an evaluation of a 1.5-year follow-up of an Internet-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for complicated grief. Treatment group patients (n = 22) were administered various assessments of complicated grief indicators, including the Impact of Event Scale, the anxiety and depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the SF-12. Results indicate that the reduction in symptoms of complicated grief observed at posttreatment was maintained at 1.5-year follow-up.
