A comparison of propranolol and nadolol pharmacokinetics and clinical effects in thyrotoxicosis.

For a comparison of propranolol and nadolol pharmacokinetics and clinical effects, 20 newly diagnosed patients with thyrotoxicosis were randomly selected to receive as sole therapy, either propranolol, 40 mg every 6 hours for 14 days, or nadolol, 80 mg each morning for 14 days. The study was repeated when the patients were in the euthyroid state. There was a similar and highly significant degree of beta blockade and amelioration of symptoms of thyrotoxicosis at the end of the dosage interval (trough), i.e., 24 hours after nadolol or 6 to 8 hours after propranolol. Trough and peak serum levels of propranolol were significantly lower when the patients were in a thyrotoxic state than when they were in a euthyroid state, whereas the pharmacokinetics of nadolol were not appreciably altered by thyrotoxicosis. In thyrotoxicosis, trough levels of propranolol and nadolol were significantly inversely correlated with derived creatinine clearance values. In the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis, nadolol, a once-daily nonmetabolized beta blocker, has certain advantages compared with propranolol. It is preferred by patients, is more convenient, and probably aids compliance.
