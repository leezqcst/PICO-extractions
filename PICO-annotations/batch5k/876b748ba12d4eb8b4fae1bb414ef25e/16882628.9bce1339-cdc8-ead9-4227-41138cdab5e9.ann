T2	Participants 95 160	Ten healthy males and ten healthy females aged 21.5 +/- 3.2 years
T3	Participants 266 309	-high volt pulsed electrical current (HVPC)
T4	Participants 313 349	delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
T5	Participants 574 633	two sets of 20 maximal eccentric elbow flexion contractions
T6	Participants 803 920	f 20 min of HVPC immediately after the induction of DOMS, and 20 min every 24 h for three consecutive days thereafter
T7	Participants 1097 1147	t 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after the induction of DOMS.
T8	Participants 1148 1299	Three weeks later, the participants returned and the protocol was repeated on the contralateral limb, using the opposite intervention (HVPC or placebo)
T9	Participants 1716 1784	ineffective in reducing the measured variables associated with DOMS.
T10	Participants 1349 1491	a significant increase in overall arm discomfort, decrease in elbow extension and decrease in isometric strength for both conditions over time
T11	Participants 351 474	Arm discomfort, elbow extension range of motion and isometric elbow flexion strength were obtained as baseline measurements
