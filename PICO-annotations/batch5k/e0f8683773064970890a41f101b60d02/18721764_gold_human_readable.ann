Participants 276 490 5
study conducted from 2000 to 2003 of palifermin, a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor, dosed from 240 microg/kg to 720 microg/kg, in 100 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients
Participants 1115 1237 3
benefits of palifermin appear primarily to be limited to ameliorating mucotoxicity when given to allogeneic HCT recipients
