Enhancing attitudes and intentions in prospective blood donors: evaluation of a new donor recruitment brochure.

BACKGROUND Although little empiric evidence has been published concerning the efficacy of blood donor recruitment materials, research suggests that simple attempts to enhance knowledge may not be sufficient to motivate donation. In contrast, recent donor motivation studies highlight the importance of anxiety, attitudes, and perceived ability to cope with donation (i.e., self-efficacy) as crucial determinants of donation intention. Therefore, recruitment materials that specifically address these constructs have the potential to outperform traditional educational brochures.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to read one of three brochures: 1) a new brochure addressing common donor concerns and suggesting specific coping strategies, 2) a standard blood center brochure, or 3) a control brochure on healthy eating and exercise. Standardized questionnaires were completed before and after the brochures to assess change in blood donation anxiety, attitude, self-efficacy, and intention.
RESULTS Although no significant changes were noted for the control brochure, after reading the new brochure participants reported significant improvements in attitude, anxiety, self-efficacy, and donation intention. The standard donation brochure had an intermediate effect.
CONCLUSION Efforts to address common donor fears and to provide useful coping suggestions may improve the effectiveness of blood donation recruitment materials.
