Effects of application in spring of urea fertiliser on aspects of reproductive performance of pasture-fed dairy cows.

AIMS To assess if raising concentrations of crude protein (CP) in pasture in spring by the frequent application of urea fertiliser would affect ovarian follicular dynamics, luteal function, onset of oestrus and reproductive performance of dairy cows under farming conditions in New Zealand.
METHODS Spring-calved dairy cows were grazed for 101 days in paddocks that were either not fertilised (Control; n=20) during the course of the study, or were fertilised with 40-50 kg nitrogen (N)/ha every 4-6 weeks (High-N; n=20). Similar generous pasture allowances were offered to both groups. Concentrations of CP in pasture, urea in serum and progesterone in milk were measured. Ovarian follicular and luteal dynamics were determined using ultrasonography. Oestrous behaviour and the number, time and outcome of inseminations were also recorded.
RESULTS Mean concentrations of CP in pasture and urea in serum was higher in the High-N than the Control group (25.2 vs 21.6 and 8.3 vs 5.4 mmol/L for CP and urea, respectively; p<0.001). Intervals between calving and first oestrus, first insemination and conception, the time of first emergence of a dominant follicle, milk progesterone concentration, and the diameter of the corpus luteum (CL) in the first luteal phase did not differ significantly between groups. The interval from calving to first ovulation tended (p=0.10) to be lower and the diameter of the dominant follicle of the oestrous cycle at which cows conceived was greater (p=0.02) in Control than High-N cows.
CONCLUSIONS The use of large amounts of urea fertiliser during spring and the consequent increases in concentrations of CP in pasture and urea in serum did not negatively affect any of the parameters of reproductive performance of pasture-fed dairy cows that were assessed in this study.
