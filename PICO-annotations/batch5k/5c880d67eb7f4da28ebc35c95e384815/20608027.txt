[Assessment of natriuretic peptide indices and oxidative stress in patients with chronic heart failure].

The authors have studied indices of natriuretic peptide and oxidative stress in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). 52 male patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis (PICS) who have developed CHF have been observed. The age of the patients varied from 38 till 60. It was established that CHF patients with progression of the disease had worsening of their clinical condition together with an increase of oxidative stress which was characterized through decrease of NO metabolites, NADPH--diaphorase (eNOS), increase of nitrite reductase (iNOS) and peroxinitrite (ONOO), correlative increase the level of brain natriuretic peptide in blood plazma. Reliable connection between considerable increase of oxidative stress and the level of NT-pro BNP was noted in CHF patients, which demands necessity of correction of observed disorders.
