Disc coablation and epidural injection of steroids: a comparison of strategies in the treatment of mechanical spinal discogenic pain.

In this study two strategies in the treatment of Mechanical Spinal Discogenic Pain have been compared: Disc Coablation and Epidural Injection of Steroids. In 2003 50 patients treated with one or two epidural injections have been selected "ad random" and 50 patients treated with disc coablation. Comparison of the data indicated an improvement of average VAS when relaxed for both groups (p < 0.01), while after slight-moderate strain, this value was significant only after coablation (p < 0.001). Finally, average VAS was clearly lower (p < 0.01) after coablation as compared to epidural injections.
