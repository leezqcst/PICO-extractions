Exposure reduced agoraphobia but not panic, and cognitive therapy reduced panic but not agoraphobia.

Earlier studies showed that cognitive therapy has anti-panic effects and exposure has anti-agoraphobic effects while other studies suggest that agoraphobia is a secondary complication of panic disorder. It was therefore hypothesized that cognitive therapy not only reduces panic but also agoraphobia and that it potentiates the effects of exposure in vivo. Two groups of 12 severe agoraphobics were treated with 4 sessions of cognitive therapy followed by 8 sessions of cognitive therapy combined with in vivo exposure. The other 12 received 4 sessions of 'associative therapy', a presumably inert treatment that controls for therapist attention, followed by 8 sessions of in vivo exposure that was framed in common behavioral terms. The initial cognitive therapy produced a significant reduction in panic frequency, while associative therapy did not affect panic. Neither cognitive therapy alone, nor associate therapy alone significantly reduced depression, state or trait anxiety, self-rated agoraphobia or behavioral avoidance. After adding exposure however, these parameters were clearly and significantly reduced. Cognitive therapy did not potentiate exposure effects. The results are discussed.
