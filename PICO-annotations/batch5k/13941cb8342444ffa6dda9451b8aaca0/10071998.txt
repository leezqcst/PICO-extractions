Anesthesia for in vitro fertilization: the addition of fentanyl to 1.5% lidocaine.

UNLABELLED Ultrasonically guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval is relatively short procedure that is performed on an out-patient basis. The optimal anesthetic technique should allow good surgical anesthesia with minimal side effects, a short recovery time, and, if possible, a high rate of successful pregnancy. Spinal anesthesia is often used in this institution, as well as many others, for this procedure. The addition of fentanyl may be effective for both intraoperative and postoperative pain relief. We assessed the effect of adding fentanyl to 1.5% lidocaine in women undergoing ultrasonically guided oocyte retrieval. Seventy-eight women were randomized to receive 45 mg of hyperbaric 1.5% lidocaine with or without 10 microg of fentanyl. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were lower in the operating room (OR) (P < 0.05) and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (P < 0.0005) for the group that received fentanyl. In addition, the amount of narcotic required in the PACU was less in the fentanyl group (P < 0.005). There was no difference in VAS scores the evening of or 24 h after the procedure. The amount of analgesics and narcotics required after discharge was the same for both groups. Timed variables, such as time to urination, ambulation, and discharge, were the same for both groups of women. The addition of fentanyl to lidocaine for transvaginal oocyte retrieval results in a more comfortable patient in the OR and PACU.
IMPLICATIONS This study demonstrates that when fentanyl is added to a local anesthetic, lidocaine, with spinal anesthesia for egg retrieval procedures, patients are more comfortable during the procedure compared with those who receive lidocaine alone. In addition, the narcotic requirements of patients are less in the postanesthesia care unit.
