Efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of feline chlamydophilosis.

The current recommended treatment for feline chlamydophilosis involves daily oral administration of antimicrobials to all cats within an affected group for a prolonged period of time (4-6 weeks). Not surprisingly, owner compliance can be poor resulting in apparent treatment failure. Recent anecdotal evidence, supported by its efficacy in the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in humans, has suggested that azithromycin may offer an alternative by allowing less frequent dosing for a shorter duration. A clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of chlamydia (Chlamydophila felis) infection in cats. Whilst azithromycin, given at 10-15 mg/kg daily for 3 days and then twice weekly, provided a similar, rapid resolution of clinical signs and negative isolation scores as doxycycline, C felis was re-isolated in four out of the five cats treated. Furthermore, even daily administration of azithromycin to chronically infected cats was ineffective in clearing infection. The azithromycin protocols used here were therefore found to be unsuccessful in eliminating the carriage of this strain of C felis.
