Impact of prior pharmacotherapy on remission of psychotic depression in a randomized controlled trial.

Having failed to respond to an adequate antidepressant treatment course predicts poorer treatment outcomes in patients with major depression. However, little is known about the impact of prior treatment on the outcome of major depression with psychotic features (MDpsy). We examined the effect of prior treatment history on the outcome of pharmacotherapy of MDpsy in patients who participated in the STOPD-PD study, a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing a combination of olanzapine plus sertraline vs. olanzapine plus placebo. The strength of treatment courses received prior to randomization was classified using a validated method. A hierarchy of outcomes was hypothesized based on treatments received prior to randomization and randomized treatment. A high remission rate was observed in subjects with a history of no prior treatment or inadequate treatment who were treated with a combination of olanzapine and sertraline. A low remission rate was observed in subjects who had previously failed to respond to an antidepressant alone and who were treated with olanzapine monotherapy. A low remission rate was also observed in subjects who had previously failed to respond to a combination of an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Similar to patients with major depression, these results emphasize the impact of prior pharmacotherapy on treatment outcomes in patients with MDpsy.
