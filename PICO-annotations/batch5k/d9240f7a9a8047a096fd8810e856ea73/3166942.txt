Psoriasis of the scalp treated with Grenz rays or topical corticosteroid combined with Grenz rays. A comparative randomized trial.

To investigate the effect of Grenz ray therapy alone compared with Grenz rays combined with a topical corticosteroid (betamethasone dipropionate) in psoriasis of the scalp, 40 patients were randomized into two groups. One group received 4 Gy of Grenz rays administered on six occasions at intervals of 1 week and the other group was given the same Grenz ray treatment plus topical corticosteroid. The patients were assessed before and after Grenz ray therapy and were followed-up for 6 months. Of the 37 patients who completed the trial 16 out of 19 (84%) of the patients in the Grenz ray group, and 13 out of 18 (72%) of the patients in the combination group healed. The remission time did not differ significantly between the two groups. Of the patients who healed, 5 of 16 patients in the Grenz ray only group and 4 of 13 patients in the combination group remained healed at 6 months. We conclude that Grenz ray therapy is a useful treatment modality for scalp psoriasis, but that the addition of a topical corticosteroid has only a minor effect.
