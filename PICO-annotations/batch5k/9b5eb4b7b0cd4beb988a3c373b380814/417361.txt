Effects of piracetam on regional cerebral blood flow and mental functions in patients with organic dementia.

The effects of piracetam (Nootropil, UCB6215) on mental functions and on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were investigated in eight patients in the presenile age who displayed symptoms of moderate dementia. The double-blind crossover design included nine measurement occasions, each involving rCBF measurement by the 133-Xe inhalation method, ratings of symptoms of dementia, personality changes, and side effects, and a psychometric investigation. Three investigations were included in each of three treatment periods. The first investigation in a period was made without medication. Then either placebo or piracetam 4.8 g/day or 9.6 g/day was given during four weeks with measurements after 2 weekks and 4 weeks. There were intervals of 4 weeks without medication between the treatment periods. Piracetam had no significant effect on either mental functions or rCBF.
