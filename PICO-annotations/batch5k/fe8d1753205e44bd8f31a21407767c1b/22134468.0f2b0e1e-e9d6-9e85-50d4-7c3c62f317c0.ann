T1	Participants 0 25	In high risk hypertensive
T2	Participants 55 196	unilateral renal artery stenosis percutaneous revascularization with stent improves blood pressure control but not glomerular filtration rate
T3	Participants 260 301	unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS), t
T4	Participants 304 433	effectiveness of percutaneous revascularization with stent (PR-STENT) on blood pressure (BP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
T5	Participants 480 614	65.7 ± 9.2 years with angiographically diagnosed unilateral RAS (≥ 60%) were randomized to receive PR-STENT (N=9) or to NO-STENT (N=9)
T6	Participants 895 952	BP and GFR values changes from baseline to the follow-up;
T7	Participants 1029 1075	Tukey's post hoc test after adjustment for age
T8	Participants 1168 1238	Baseline systolic BP and GFR values were not different between groups.
T9	Participants 1290 1362	PR-STENT than in NO-STENT at univariate analysis at the end of follow-up
T10	Participants 1647 1681	systolic BP without improving GFR.
