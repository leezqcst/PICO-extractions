T1	Participants 534 763	757 patients from the GISSI-3 echo substudy population with their first acute myocardial infarct were studied by echocardiography at 24-48 hours from symptom onset (S1), at discharge (S2), at six weeks (S3), and at six months (S4
T2	Participants 481 511	47 Italian coronary care units
T3	Participants 963 1049	64 patients (8%), left ventricular thrombosis was detected in one or more examinations
T4	Participants 1079 1568	693 patients, subjects with left ventricular thrombosis were older (mean (SD) age: 64.6 (13.0) v 59.8 (11.7) years, p < 0.005), and had larger infarcts (extent of wall motion asynergy: 40.9 (11.5)% v 24.9 (14)%, p < 0.001), greater depression of left ventricular ejection fraction at S1 (43.3 (6.9)% v 48.1 (6.8)%, p < 0.001), and greater left ventricular volumes at S1 (end diastolic volume: 87 (22) v 78 (18) ml/m(2), p < 0.001; end systolic volume: 50 (17) v 41 (14) ml/m(2), p < 0.001)
