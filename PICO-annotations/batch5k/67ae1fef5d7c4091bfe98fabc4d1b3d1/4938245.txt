Persistent phenothiazine dyskinesia treated with tetrabenazine.

Six patients with persistent phenothiazine dyskinesia were treated in a double-blind controlled trial with tetrabenazine 100 mg in divided dosage. In three patients the abnormal movements were abolished and in two others there was some improvement, but this was no greater than that achieved with the diazepam control. Tetrabenazine may be useful in the treatment of some patients with persistent phenothiazine dyskinesia.
