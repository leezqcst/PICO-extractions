To study the ability of Lactobacillus GG(LGG) to colonize the neonatal gut and modify its microbial ecology, a prospective, randomized study was performed in 71 preterm infants of less than 2000 g birth weight. Infants less than 1500 g (24 treated, 15 control) received 10(9) LGG orally twice daily for 21 days. Those infants weighing 1500 to 1999 g (23 treated, 9 control) were treated for 8 days.
