Evaluation of an aquatics programme on fitness parameters of individuals with a brain injury.

The primary objective was to determine the effect of an aquatic exercise programme on the physical fitness of people with a brain injury. A pre-test-post-test randomized-groups design was conducted. Sixteen outpatients with a brain injury were included in the study. Eight participants were assigned to an aquatic exercise group and eight to a control group. The components of physical fitness measured included cardiovascular endurance, body composition, muscular strength and endurance and flexibility. Measurements were taken pre- and post-programme. Results indicated an increase in components of physical fitness for the experimental group but not the control group. Increases in fitness were reported as having a positive impact on the functional capacity of individuals in the exercise group as well as enhancing the individual's ability to complete activities of daily living successfully. Results indicate that aquatic exercise may positively impact the primary and secondary physical injuries caused by a brain injury.
