Participants 127 221 4
in patients with heart failure (HF) with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions (EFs)
Participants 452 643 7
between 185 patients with systolic HF (79% men, mean age 62.6 +/- 10.9 years) and 43 with diastolic HF (54% men, mean age 67.4 +/- 9.8 years) enrolled in a phase II multicenter clinical trial
Participants 1101 1275 3
Patients in the diastolic HF group tended to be older (p <0.08), with more women (p <0.006) and with greater body mass indexes (p <0.02), than those in the systolic HF group.
