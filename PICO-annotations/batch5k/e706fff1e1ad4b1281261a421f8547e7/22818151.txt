[Localised prostate cancer: the PREFERE trial].

Prostate cancer is the most common carcinoma of the elderly man and holds the third place in the ranking of cancer-specific mortality. However, mortality rates of 3 % are low, and half of the patients will die from intercurrent disease. Due to the significantly improved diagnostic methods and the increasing use of PSA screening, there has been a stage migration towards early tumour stages that are prognostically heterogeneous and require differentiated treatment. Based on the discussions of the Joint Federal Committee (G-BA) and the conceptual work of the MDS, the Competence Centre Oncology of the MDK, the IQWIG and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband), a prospective randomised multicentre trial was developed comparing the four treatments actually recommended by the German and European guidelines for localised prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy, percutaneous radiotherapy and permanent seed implantation and active surveillance) allowing a rejection of one or two treatment options. The trial is expected to start at the beginning of next year.
