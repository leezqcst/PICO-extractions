[Intra-arterial chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancers. 2. Therapeutic results in relation to prognostic factors].

85 patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas were treated either intra-arterially with MTX and 5-FU, later systemically with the CMFV-combination (therapy arm A) or only systemically (therapy arm B) after randomization. The achieved rates of remission and survival time showed an obvious dependence on the histological type of tumor and on the degree of differentiation. Whereas the results of the treatment were nearly identical in both groups of treatment with badly differentiated carcinomas, a significant improvement could be achieved by the initial local treatment of well and moderately differentiated malignancies. More than one third of the cases of advanced tumors were operable by local chemotherapy. Thus the survival time could be extended. The intra-arterial chemotherapy represents an expensive, but effective method of treatment of advanced ovarian carcinomas.
