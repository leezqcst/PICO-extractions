T1	Participants 105 155	in an area of low malaria transmission in Colombia
T2	Participants 675 800	Patients > or =1 year of age with a parasite density > or =1,000 asexual parasites per microliter were enrolled in this study
T3	Participants 802 1050	Forty-four percent (24 of 54) of the CQ-treated patients were therapeutic failures, including 7 early treatment failures (ETFs) and 17 late treatment failures (LTFs). Four (6%) of 67 SP-treated patients were therapeutic failures (2 ETFs and 2 LTFs)
T4	Participants 364 673	A modified World Health Organization 14-day in vivo drug efficacy test for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in areas with intense malaria transmission was adapted to reflect the clinical and epidemiologic features of a low-intensity malaria transmission area in the Pacific Coast Region of Colombia
