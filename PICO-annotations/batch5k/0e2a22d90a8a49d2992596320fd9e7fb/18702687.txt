Long pediatric colonoscope versus intermediate length adult colonoscope for colonoscopy.

BACKGROUND Controversy exists on how the length and diameter of colonoscopes affect the quality of colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to compare a long pediatric colonoscope with an intermediate length adult colonoscope with regards to completion rate and cecal intubation time. Whether either scope may be more efficient in any subgroups was also investigated.
METHODS Asymptomatic patients admitted to the physical check-up department of Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital were included. A single endoscopist performed all of the colonoscopic examinations under sedation. Consecutive patients were randomized to undergo colonoscopy with either intermediate length adult colonoscope (CF-240I) or long pediatric colonoscope (PCF-240L). The success rate and time required to reach cecum were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS Between April 2005 and February 2006, a total of 918 patients were enrolled. Incomplete colonoscopy occurred in 21 (2.3%) cases (14 in the CF-240I group and seven in the PCF-240L group, P > 0.1). The overall cecal mean insertion time was 6.00 +/- 3.66 min. There was no significant difference between the CF-240I and PCF 240L groups with regard to the cecal intubation rate (96.9% vs 98.5%, P = 0.18), the need for abdominal pressure (71.7% vs 73.4%, P = 0.55) and change of position (13.5% vs 11.5%, P = 0.37). However, the cecal intubation time was shorter in the CF-240I group (5.75 +/- 3.18 vs 6.26 +/- 3.30 min, P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis by sex, age, and body mass index showed comparable outcomes between the two groups except that the cecal intubation times were significantly shorter in the CF-240I group when only men (4.78 +/- 2.57 vs 5.50 +/- 2.93 min, P < 0.01) or those younger than 50 years (5.50 +/- 2.90 vs 6.25 +/- 3.68 min, P = 0.02) were considered.
CONCLUSION Cecal intubation time is shorter in patients examined with an intermediate length adult colonoscope, mainly in the subgroups of men and those younger than 50 years of age.
