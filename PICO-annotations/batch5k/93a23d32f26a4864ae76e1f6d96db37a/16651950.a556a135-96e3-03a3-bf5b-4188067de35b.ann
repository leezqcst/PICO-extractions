T1	Participants 1528 1608	CONCLUSIONS The barbed suture represents an innovative option for wound closure.
T2	Participants 1172 1252	RESULTS The study enrolled 195 patients, of whom 188 were eligible for analysis.
T3	Participants 600 925	METHODS This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was designed to show that the use of barbed suture in dermal closure of the Pfannenstiel incision during nonemergent cesarean delivery surgery produces scar cosmesis at 5 weeks that is no worse than that observed with conventional closure using 3-0 polydioxanone suture.
T4	Participants 74 215	BACKGROUND Suture knots present several disadvantages in wound closure, because they are tedious to tie and place ischemic demands on tissue.
