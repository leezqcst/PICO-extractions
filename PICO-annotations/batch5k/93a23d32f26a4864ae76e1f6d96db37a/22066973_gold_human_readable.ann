Participants 123 307 6
BACKGROUND To test the hypothesis that 5 mg/mL tramadol is superior to 3 ?g/mL fentanyl when combined with 0.125% ropivacaine in parturients undergoing labor during epidural analgesia.
Participants 308 554 6
METHODS Sixty-one parturients undergoing labor selected for delivery with epidural analgesia were randomized into two groups: Group tramadol (0.125% ropivacaine plus tramadol 5 mg/mL) and Group fentanyl (0.125% ropivacaine plus fentanyl 3 ug/mL).
