T1	Participants 1697 1849	CONCLUSIONS Our observations suggest that tramadol seems to be a safe alternative to fentanyl for labor analgesia due to its similar analgesic efficacy.
T2	Participants 922 1237	RESULTS The two groups had no significant differences with respect to maternal hemodynamics, neonatal heart rate, VAS scores, rate of cesarean delivery, sensory block level, Bromage motor scale scores, instrument-assisted delivery, oxytocin use, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression (p > 0.05).
T3	Participants 308 554	METHODS Sixty-one parturients undergoing labor selected for delivery with epidural analgesia were randomized into two groups: Group tramadol (0.125% ropivacaine plus tramadol 5 mg/mL) and Group fentanyl (0.125% ropivacaine plus fentanyl 3 ug/mL).
T4	Participants 123 307	BACKGROUND To test the hypothesis that 5 mg/mL tramadol is superior to 3 ?g/mL fentanyl when combined with 0.125% ropivacaine in parturients undergoing labor during epidural analgesia.
T5	Participants 0 121	Comparison of epidural tramadol-ropivacaine and fentanyl-ropivacaine for labor analgesia: a prospective randomized study.
