T1	Participants 1387 1604	CONCLUSIONS Incidence of AF after coronary operation was significantly reduced by the administration of sotalol alone and magnesium alone; more importantly, the incidence was further reduced by combining these agents.
T2	Participants 469 922	METHODS Two hundred seven consecutive coronary artery bypass patients (mean age 62 +/- 11 years) were randomized to receive sotalol alone (80 mg twice daily for 5 days starting from the morning of the first postoperative day) (group S), magnesium alone (1.5 g daily for 6 days starting in the operating room just before cardiopulmonary bypass) (group M), both pharmacologic agents at the same dosages (group S+M), or no antiarrhythmic agents (group CTR)
T3	Participants 106 227	BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication reported in 20% to 40% of patients after coronary operations
T4	Participants 993 1160	RESULTS The incidence of postoperative AF was 11.8% (6/51) in the S group, 14.8% (8/54) in the M group, 1.9% (1/52) in the S+M group, and 38% (19/50) in the CTR group.
