[Prevention of migraine with flunarizine and acetylsalicylic acid. A double-blind study].

UNLABELLED 30 children between 7 and 17 years suffering from at least 2 attacks/month of common or classical migraine since more than 1 year were studied. After clinical exclusion of symptomatic headache 4 weeks were documented by means of a migraine diary. Prophylaxis with Calcium entry blocker Flunarizine (Sibelium) or Thromboxane A inhibitor Acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) was carried out in a double blind design for 3 months. Medication was given as one dosage in the evening: 2-5 mg/kg KG ASS or 5-10 mg Flunarizine. Documented attack frequency and duration were controlled at monthly physical examinations. Final results showed no differences in significant reduction of attack frequency or symptoms between both different therapeutic principals. 72.4% (ASS 73.3%; Flunarizine 71.4%) of patients were attack-free or had at least a 50% reduction. Migraine frequency of initially 7-8 was reduced to 1-2 attacks/month. Duration remained constant in both groups (1-3 h). Side effects were slight body weight gain or abdominal pain after intake, prophylaxis had not to be interrupted therefore. Longtime prognosis is not yet possible because the time of observation is too short so far.
CONCLUSION Both substances are definitely useful and have few side effects in childhood migraine. If the response to one is insufficient the other substance should be tried.
