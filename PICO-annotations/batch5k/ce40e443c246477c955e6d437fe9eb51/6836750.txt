Pilot study with adjuvant hormone therapy in FIGO stage I endometrial carcinoma with myometrial invasion.

A pilot study with adjuvant hormone therapy in FIGO stage I endometrial carcinoma with myometrial invasion was carried out. All patients received total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy plus complementary radium therapy on the vaginal stump. After the conventional treatment, patients were randomly allocated to adjuvant hormone therapy or no further treatment. Hormone therapy consisted of gestonorone caproate (17 alpha-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-en 3, 20 dione caproate) administered i.m. at the dose of 200 mg/week for 1 year. Of the 62 patients who entered the study, 51 were considered evaluable (24 with adjuvant hormone therapy and 27 with no further treatment). Five patients had a relapse: four of these were in the group with no further treatment. Actuarial relapse-free survival analysis at 5 years was 95.7% in the group of adjuvant-treated patients and 82.8% in the control group. Although there is no statistical significance, adjuvant therapy appears to result in an increase in relapse-free survival in the group of patients with deep myometrial invasion and undifferentiated carcinoma. Further studies are necessary to assess the effectiveness of hormone adjuvant treatment in FIGO stage I endometrial carcinoma with myometrial invasion.
