T1	Participants 0 80	Matched-pair analysis of all-polyethylene versus metal-backed tibial components.
T2	Participants 82 145	Forty-eight matched pairs of osteoarthritic knees from patients
T3	Participants 215 330	Apollo Knee System were studied to evaluate the outcome between all-polyethylene and metal-backed tibial components
T4	Participants 332 455	Patients were matched for patient factors, preoperative deformities, cruciate salvage or sacrifice, and surgical technique.
T5	Participants 912 1131	We advocate the use of a more cost-effective all-polyethylene tibial component in elderly patients (>70 years old) who are not likely to need the versatility of exchange of a modular polyethylene insert because of wear.
T6	Participants 629 690	No component required revision, and no revisions were pending
T7	Participants 721 910	over time would project into better long-term success for all-polyethylene tibial components because of the amount of wear and osteolysis with current modular metal-backed tibial components
