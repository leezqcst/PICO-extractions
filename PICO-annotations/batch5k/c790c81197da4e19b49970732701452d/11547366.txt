Matched-pair analysis of all-polyethylene versus metal-backed tibial components.

Forty-eight matched pairs of osteoarthritic knees from patients who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty with a round-on-round, Apollo Knee System were studied to evaluate the outcome between all-polyethylene and metal-backed tibial components. Patients were matched for patient factors, preoperative deformities, cruciate salvage or sacrifice, and surgical technique. At the last follow-up (average, 38.4 months), there was no statistically significant difference in terms of knee scores, patient self-assessment, and radiographic outcomes. No component required revision, and no revisions were pending. Maintenance of these results over time would project into better long-term success for all-polyethylene tibial components because of the amount of wear and osteolysis with current modular metal-backed tibial components. We advocate the use of a more cost-effective all-polyethylene tibial component in elderly patients (>70 years old) who are not likely to need the versatility of exchange of a modular polyethylene insert because of wear.
