Prediction of the response to citalopram and reboxetine in post-stroke depressed patients.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE Depression is a significant complication of stroke. The effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in the management of post-stroke depression (PSD) has been widely investigated. However, the choice of antidepressant drug is critically influenced by its safety and tolerability and by its effect on concurrent pathologies. Here we investigate the efficacy and safety of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, and a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NARI), reboxetine, in post-stroke patients affected by anxious depression or retarded depression.
METHODS This was a randomized double-blind study. Seventy-four post-stroke depressed patients were diagnosed as affected by anxious or retarded depression by using a synoptic table. Randomisation was planned so that 50% of the patients in each subgroup were assigned for 16 weeks to treatment with citalopram and the remaining 50% were assigned to treatment with reboxetine. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and a synoptic table were used to score depressive symptoms.
RESULTS Both citalopram and reboxetine showed good safety and tolerability. Citalopram exhibited greater efficacy in anxious depressed patients, while reboxetine was more effective in retarded depressed patients.
CONCLUSIONS Citalopram or other SSRIs and reboxetine may be of first choice treatment in PSD because of their good efficacy and lack of severe side effects. In addition, PSD patients should be classified according to their clinical profile (similarly to patients affected by primary depression) for the selection of SSRIs or reboxetine as drugs of choice in particular subgroups of patients.
