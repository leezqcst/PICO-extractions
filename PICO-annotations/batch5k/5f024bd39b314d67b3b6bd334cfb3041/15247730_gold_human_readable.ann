Participants 188 315 3
the stone capture rate of 9 commercially available tipless stone baskets in an in vitro model using novice and expert operators
Participants 317 586 4
MATERIALS AND METHODS The Microvasive Zerotip (2.4Fr, 3.0Fr), Cook N-Circle (2.2Fr, 3.0Fr, 3.2Fr), Bard Dimension (3.0Fr, Sacred Heart Medical Halo (1.9Fr), Vantage (1.9Fr) and Circon-ACMI Sur-Catch-NT (3.0Fr) were tested by 3 novice and 3 experienced basket operators.
Participants 922 1123 4
RESULTS After a learning curve of 27 basket retrievals, there was no significant difference in stone capture times between novice (38 +/- 54 seconds) and expert operators (32 +/- 49 seconds, p = 0.174)
