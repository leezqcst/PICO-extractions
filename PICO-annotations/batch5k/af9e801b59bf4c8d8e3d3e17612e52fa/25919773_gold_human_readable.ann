PATIENTS AND METHODS Four hundred and seventy-five patients who presented with dyspeptic complaints and underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastric biopsy were included in this study
Participants 1725 1889 4
RESULTS The frequency of H. pylori infection was significantly lower in the filling group compared with the nonfilling group (53.7 and 78.8%, respectively; P<0.001)
Participants 2635 2876 3
CONCLUSION This is the first study to show a lower frequency of H. pylori colonization in patients with amalgam fillings than without and that H. pylori eradication rates are lower in patients with amalgam fillings compared to those without.
