T1	Participants 33 109	ropivacaine/fentanyl for postoperative patient-controlled epidural analgesia
T2	Participants 145 199	a new local anesthetic approved for epidural analgesia
T3	Participants 349 391	improve analgesia or decrease side effects
T4	Participants 401 451	Thirty patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery
T5	Participants 743 805	Patient-controlled epidural analgesia settings and adjustments
T6	Participants 882 1088	Pain scores (rest, cough, and ambulation), side effects (nausea, pruritus, sedation, motor block, hypotension, and orthostasis), and patient-controlled epidural analgesia consumption were measured for 48 h.
T7	Participants 1097 1146	All three solutions produced equivalent analgesia
T8	Participants 1279 1346	side effects were equivalent between solutions and mild in severity
T9	Participants 1566 1730	Lesser concentrations of ropivacaine and fentanyl provide comparable analgesia with less motor block despite the use of similar amounts of ropivacaine and fentanyl.
T10	Participants 1804 1926	low doses is a primary determinant of motor block with patient-controlled epidural analgesia after lower abdominal surgery
