Caudal neostigmine with bupivacaine produces a dose-independent analgesic effect in children.

PURPOSE To evaluate the analgesic efficacy and duration of varying doses of caudal neostigmine with plain bupivacaine and its side effects in children undergoing genito-urinary surgery.
METHODS In a randomized double-blind prospective study 80 boys aged two to eight years scheduled for surgical repair of hypospadias were allocated randomly to one of four groups (n = 20 each) and received either only caudal 0.25% plain bupivacaine 0.5 mL.kg(-1) (Group I) or 0.25% plain bupivacaine 0.5 mL.kg(-1) with neostigmine (Groups II-IV) in doses of 2, 3 and 4 microg.kg(-1) respectively. Postoperative pain was assessed for 24 hr using an objective pain score. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, total amount of analgesic consumed and adverse effects were also recorded.
RESULTS The duration of postoperative analgesia in Group I (5.1 +/- 2.3 hr) was significantly shorter than in the other three groups (II -16.6 +/- 4.9 hr; III - 17.2 +/- 5.5 hr; IV - 17.0 +/- 5.8 hr; P < 0.05). Total analgesic (paracetamol) consumption was significantly more in Group I (697.6 +/- 240.7 mg) than in the groups receiving caudal neostigmine (II - 248.0 +/- 178.4; III - 270.2 +/- 180.8 and IV -230.6 +/- 166.9 mg; P < 0.05). Groups II, III and IV were comparable with regards to duration of postoperative analgesia and total analgesic consumption (P > 0.05). Incidence of nausea and vomiting were comparable in all four groups. No significant alteration in vital signs or any other adverse effects were observed.
CONCLUSIONS Caudal neostigmine (2, 3 and 4 microg.kg(-1)) with bupivacaine produces a dose-independent analgesic effect ( approximately 16-17 hr) in children as compared to those receiving caudal bupivacaine alone (approximately five hours) and a reduction in postoperative rescue analgesic consumption without increasing the incidence of adverse effects.
