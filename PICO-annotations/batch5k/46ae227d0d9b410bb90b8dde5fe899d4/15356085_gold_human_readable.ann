The additive effects of low-dose flutamide (62.5 mg/d) were assessed over 3 months in young patients with hyperinsulinemic ovarian hyperandrogenism (n = 40; age, approximately 17 yr; body mass index, approximately 22 kg/m(2)); all participants started on metformin (850 mg/d) and a fourth-generation contraceptive (ethinylestradiol 30 microg plus drospirenone 3 mg, 21 d/month), and they were randomized to receive flutamide in addition (n = 20) or not (n = 20).
