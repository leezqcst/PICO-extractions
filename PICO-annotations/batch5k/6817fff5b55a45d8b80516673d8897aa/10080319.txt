Masticatory performance and chewing experience with implant-retained mandibular overdentures.

The relationship between masticatory performance and chewing experience has not yet been explored for patients with implant-retained overdentures. Although many relationships have been found between parameters of objective and subjective oral function, the structure of these relationships remain unclear. Therefore, we studied in a randomized clinical trial the relationship between the comminution of an artificial test food, i.e. masticatory performance, and the subjective chewing experience. The trial involved a comparison between two groups receiving implant treatment and one group receiving conventional complete dentures (CD). The implant treatment involved either a mainly implant-supported mandibular overdenture on a transmandibular implant (TMI) or an implant-tissue-supported mandibular overdenture on two IMZ implants (IMZ). Masticatory performance as well as chewing experience were substantially better for the implant-retained overdentures compared with the complete denture group. No significant differences emerged between the TMI and the IMZ group. A multiple regression analysis did not provide any comprehensibility in the relationship between masticatory performance and the variables of chewing experience. In the linear structural relation analysis (LISREL) no direct relationship was found between masticatory performance and functional complaints mandibular denture. The results show that an improvement in masticatory performance does not imply the same improvement in chewing experience and vice versa.
