T1	Participants 0 110	Predictors of postdischarge outcomes from information acquired shortly after admission for acute heart failure
T2	Participants 183 253	A1 Adenosine Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline for Patients Hospitalized
T3	Participants 259 389	Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on Congestion and Renal Function (PROTECT) Study.
T4	Participants 402 482	Acute heart failure is a common reason for admission, and outcome is often poor.
T5	Participants 483 590	Improved prognostic risk stratification may assist in the design of future trials and in patient management
T6	Participants 851 1035	The prognostic model included 37 clinical characteristics collected at baseline in PROTECT, a study comparing rolofylline and placebo in 2033 patients admitted with acute heart failure
T7	Participants 1354 1409	Blood urea was generally the strongest single predictor
T8	Participants 1823 1997	A few simple clinical variables measured on admission in patients with acute heart failure predict a variety of adverse outcomes with accuracy similar to more complex models.
T9	Participants 1411 1516	Eighteen variables contributed independent prognostic information, but a reduced model using only 8 items
T10	Participants 2007 2110	predictive models were of only moderate accuracy, especially for outcomes that included nonfatal events
T11	Participants 2228 2276	Unique identifiers: NCT00328692 and NCT00354458.
