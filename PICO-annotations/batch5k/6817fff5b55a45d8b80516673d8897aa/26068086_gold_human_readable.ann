OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of intravitreal ocriplasmin on patient-reported visual function using the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) during a 6-month follow-up in patients with symptomatic VMA.
Participants 918 1046 7
A total of 652 patients with symptomatic VMA/VMT, including when associated with a macular hole 400 μm or smaller, were studied
