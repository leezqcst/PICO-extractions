T1	Participants 434 608	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo sphincterotomy over a non-conductive guidewire with 30 W/sec pure-cut current or 30 W/sec blend-2 current by a blinded endoscopist.

T3	Participants 1577 1682	There was a significant increase in minor bleeding episodes (grade 2) in the pure-cut group (p < 0.0001).
T4	Participants 1683 1742	Delayed episodes of bleeding were equal (n = 3) in each arm
T5	Participants 1683 1742	Delayed episodes of bleeding were equal (n = 3) in each arm
T6	Participants 108 138	a prospective randomized trial
T7	Participants 1069 1150	A total of 246 patients were randomized (116 pure-cut current, 130 blend current)
