Multiple doses of secretin in the treatment of autism: a controlled study.

UNLABELLED Dramatic effects on autistic behaviour after repeated injections of the gastrointestinal hormone secretin have been referred in a number of case reports. In the absence of curative and effective treatments for this disabling condition, this information has created new hope among parents. Although controlled studies on the effect of mainly one single dose have not documented any effect, many children still continue to receive secretin. Six children enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which each child was its own control. Human synthetic secretin, mean dose 3.4 clinical units, and placebo were administered intravenously in randomized order every 4th wk, on three occasions each. The measurement instruments were the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the aberrant behaviour checklist (ABC). Statistically significant differences were found for placebo in 3 out of 6 children and for secretin in one child, using parental ratings only (VAS scores). Differences were small and lacked clinical significance, which was in accordance with the overall impression of the parents and teachers and visual inspection of graphs.
CONCLUSION In this placebo-controlled study, multiple doses of secretin did not produce any symptomatic improvement.
