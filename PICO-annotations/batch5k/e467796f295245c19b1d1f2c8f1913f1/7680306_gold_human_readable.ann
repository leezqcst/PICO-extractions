49 patients (22 women, 27 men, mean age 43.7 [21-65] years) with Hodgkin's disease were examined by Doppler echocardiography a median of 5.37 (2-10) years after the end of chemotherapy (given according to the COPP/ABVD scheme, with or without mediastinal irradiation) for possible chronic changes in myocardium, pericardium or cardiac valves, as well as for any haemodynamic sequelae. Maximal and integrated early (E, Ei) and late (A, Ai) diastolic flow velocities and their ratio (E/A, Ei/Ai) were measured by pulsed Doppler over the mitral and tricuspid valves. Although on two-dimensional echo 21 patients (42.9%) were found to have valvar thickening, 19 (38.8%) pericardial thickening and 9 (18.4%) a reduced fibre shortening fraction, the Doppler indices were statistically not significantly different from those in 25 controls with normal hearts.
