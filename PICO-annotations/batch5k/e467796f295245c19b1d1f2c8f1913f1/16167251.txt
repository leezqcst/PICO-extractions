[Usage of titanoreine after procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of titanoreine on early postoperative symptoms after procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH).
METHODS From November 2002 to July 2003, 80 patients who received PPH were randomly divided in to titanoreine group (n=42) and control group without titanoreine (n=38). Symptom relief was recorded 24 hours, 6 days and 12 days after PPH, urine retention 24h after PPH, first stool time, wound healing time, mean hospital stay were also recorded.
RESULTS The score of symptom was lower in titanoreine group (4.4) than that in the control group (6.1) 24 hours after PPH (P< 0.05), but no significant difference in symptom grade was found between the two groups 6 days and 12 days after PPH (P> 0.05). Decrements of symptom grade were lower in titanoreine group than those of control group at any point after PPH (P< 0.05). There was no significant difference in urine retention rate and mean hospital stay between two groups(P> 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS Titanoreine can effectively relieve the early postoperative symptoms after PPH.
