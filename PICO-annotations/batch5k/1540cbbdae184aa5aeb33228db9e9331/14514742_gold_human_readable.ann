To investigate the clinical effects of a novel PD fluid buffered with 34 mM pure bicarbonate at neutral pH, a randomized, prospective, crossover comparison with conventional, acidic, 35 mM lactate PD fluid was performed for two consecutive 12-wk periods with 28 children (age, 6 mo to 15 yr) undergoing automated PD (APD).
