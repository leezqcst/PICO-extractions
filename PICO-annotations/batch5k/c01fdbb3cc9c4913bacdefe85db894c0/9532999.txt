The reliability of catheter-tip transducers for the measurement of intrauterine pressure in the third stage of labour.

In order to assess the reliability of intrauterine pressure measurements in the third stage of labour, catheter-tip transducers were used in 20 women randomly allocated into two groups of 10. In each case in the first group two catheters were tied together and introduced transcervically into the uterine cavity after delivery of the placenta. In each case in the second group two catheters were inserted independently into the same uterine cavity. The active and cumulative active pressures recorded from the pairs of catheters within each uterine cavity were compared. Comparison of individual active pressure readings from separate transducers revealed good agreement whether the catheters were tied together or were separate. Cumulative active pressure was very similar when assessed by each catheter in the same uterus. Intrauterine catheter-tip transducers can be used reliably to measure uterine activity in the third stage of labour although there may be minor contraction by contraction differences in recordings of individual active pressures.
