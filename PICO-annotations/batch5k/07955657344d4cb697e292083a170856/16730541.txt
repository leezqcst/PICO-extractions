Thermal welding versus bipolar tonsillectomy: a comparative study.

OBJECTIVE To compare thermal welding tonsillectomy (TWT) with bipolar electrocautery tonsillectomy (BET) procedure.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING A prospective randomized study was conducted on 150 consecutive adult patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Indications included chronic tonsillitis and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Exclusion criteria included peritonsillar abscess history, bleeding disorders, and any other procedure together with tonsillectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to TWT or BET groups. Intraoperative bleeding, operative time, postoperative pain, complication rates, and return to normal diet were evaluated.
RESULTS In the TWT group there was no measurable intraoperative bleeding, while mean bleeding for BET group was 16 mL. No significant difference regarding mean operative time was noticed. Mean postoperative pain score and mean time for return to normal diet were significantly lower in the TWT group. Primary hemorrhage occurred in 1 subject of the BET group. Secondary postoperative hemorrhage was noticed in 1 subject of the TWT group and 3 subjects of the BET group.
CONCLUSION Thermal welding tonsillectomy procedure provides sufficient hemostasis, lower postoperative pain, and quick return to normal diet.
EBM RATING A-1b.
