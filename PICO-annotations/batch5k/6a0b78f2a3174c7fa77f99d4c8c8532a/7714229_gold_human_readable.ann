Scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment was used in healthy men to evaluate the central nervous system activity of the new cholinomimetic SDZ ENS-163. Eighteen subjects were treated in a crossover design with oral placebo/intravenous saline, 50 mg of oral SDZ ENS-163/intravenous saline, oral placebo/0.4 mg of intravenous scopolamine, and 50 mg of oral SDZ ENS-163/0.4 mg of intravenous scopolamine.
