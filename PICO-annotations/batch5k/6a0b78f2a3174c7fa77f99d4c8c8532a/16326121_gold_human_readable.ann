We studied nine subjects (eight men and one woman; mean age+/-SD: 31.3+/-11.0 yr) with mild intermittent allergic asthma, never treated with regular beta2-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids. In a previous allergen challenge all subjects had shown a positive early airway response (EAR) to allergen.
