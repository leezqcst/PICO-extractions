T1	Participants 35 130	assessing theory of mind in normal children and children with pervasive developmental disorders
T2	Participants 264 364	theory of mind ability in normal children and children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs)
T3	Participants 366 496	In Study 1, TOM test scores of normal children (n = 70) correlated positively with their performance on other theory of mind tasks
T4	Participants 879 1401	Study 2 showed for a separate sample of normal children (n = 12) that the TOM test possesses sufficient test-retest stability. Study 3 demonstrated for a sample of children with PDDs (n = 10) that the interrater reliability of the TOM test is good. Study 4 found that children with PDDs (n = 20) had significantly lower TOM test scores than children with other psychiatric disorders (e.g., children with Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; n = 32), a finding that underlines the discriminant validity of the TOM test
