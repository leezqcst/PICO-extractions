Use of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate to reduce failure of intravenous infusion due to phlebitis and extravasation.

Self-adhesive patches which release glyceryl trinitrate at a slow continuous rate or placebo patches were applied to the skin of patients distal to intravenous infusion sites in a double-blind manner. The frequency of infusion failure was three times lower with the glyceryl trinitrate than with placebo patches. The decrease was of similar magnitude whether failure was due to extravasation or phlebitis. Headaches were more common in patients with active patches but were relieved by simple analgesics.
