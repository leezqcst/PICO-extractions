T1	Participants 326 1151	To investigate the effect of exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on nasal airways resistance (NAR) and inflammatory mediators in nasal lavage fluid, eight subjects with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, who were tested out of season, were exposed in a randomized single-blind, crossover study to either air or 400 ppb NO2 for 6 hours. The changes in NAR and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), mast cell tryptase (MCT), neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in nasal lavage fluid before and after exposure were evaluated. Another group of eight subjects with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis were also randomized to exposure to air or 400 ppb NO2 for 6 hours and then challenged with allergen, before evaluation for changes in NAR and changes in ECP, MCT, MPO, and IL-8 in nasal lavage fluid.
