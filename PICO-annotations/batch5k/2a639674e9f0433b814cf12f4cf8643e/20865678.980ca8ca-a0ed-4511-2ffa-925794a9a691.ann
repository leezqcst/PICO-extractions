T1	Participants 1158 1392	CONCLUSIONS A short period of exercise training in CAD patients improved their physical capacity, but did not influence BMI, WHR and waist circumference. Exercise training prevented an increase in leptin levels during the study period
T2	Participants 683 814	RESULTS Physical capacity increased significantly only in Ex patients (max workload in METs from 7.7 ± 1.4 to 8.2 ± 1.4, p < 0.05).
T3	Participants 266 495	METHODS Sixty-four male patients, mean age 55.6 ± 6.0 years, were randomized either to six weeks of aerobic training, three times a week, at 60-80% of maximal heart rate (training group, Ex, n = 32) or to a control group (n = 32)
T4	Participants 113 265	BACKGROUND This study was designed to examine the influence of exercise training on leptin levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).
