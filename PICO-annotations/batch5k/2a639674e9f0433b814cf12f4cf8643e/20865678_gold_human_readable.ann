BACKGROUND This study was designed to examine the influence of exercise training on leptin levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).
Participants 266 495 8
METHODS Sixty-four male patients, mean age 55.6 Â± 6.0 years, were randomized either to six weeks of aerobic training, three times a week, at 60-80% of maximal heart rate (training group, Ex, n = 32) or to a control group (n = 32

0.02).
CONCLUSIONS A short period of exercise training in CAD patients improved their physical capacity, but did not influence BMI, WHR and waist circumference. Exercise training prevented an increase in leptin levels during the study
