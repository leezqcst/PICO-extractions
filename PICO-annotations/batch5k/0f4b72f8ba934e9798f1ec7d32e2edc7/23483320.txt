Effect of perioperative parecoxib on postoperative pain and local inflammation factors PGE2 and IL-6 for total knee arthroplasty: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

To assess the efficacy of postoperative pain management and the concentration change of PGE-2 and IL-6 of joint fluid with parecoxib after postoperative total knee arthroplasty. In the study, 100 patients experiencing primary TKA were randomly divided into study group, receiving parecoxib sodium (40 mg) intravenously (IV) at the completion of surgery and once every 12 h for totally 6 times postoperatively, and placebo group, receiving normal saline 2 mL IV at the same time points. Efficacy was assessed by total amount of morphine consumed, pain intensity, range of motion (ROM), the concentration change of PGE-2 and IL-6 of joint fluid, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) postoperatively. Patients in study group consumed significantly less morphine, experienced significant less pain scores, and obtained significantly more ROM (P < 0.01) compared with that in placebo group during 3 days postoperatively. The concentration of PGE-2 and IL-6 of joint fluid in study group are significantly lower than that in placebo group (P < 0.01) during 24 h postoperatively. The overall incidence of PONV was low and was not significantly different between the two groups. The present study demonstrated that the perioperative administration of parecoxib after primary TKA resulted in significantly improved postoperative analgesic management as defined by reduction in opioid requirement, lower pain scores and ROM, and significantly lowered local inflammation factors PGE2 and IL-6.
