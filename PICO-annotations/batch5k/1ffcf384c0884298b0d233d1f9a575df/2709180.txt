Effects of heat and cold on the perineum after episiotomy/laceration.

The Redness Edema Ecchymosis Discharge Approximation (REEDA) tool, devised to evaluate postpartum healing of the perineum following an episiotomy/laceration, was used to evaluate the effects of heat and cold on the perineum during the first 24 hours after delivery. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Treatment consisted of 30 subjects applying a warm perineal pack, 30 applying a cold perineal pack, and 30 taking a warm sitz bath. Analysis of variance indicated no difference in the REEDA score before or two hours after treatment. A Pearson r correlation indicated the REEDA score was associated with a laceration and not with infant weight. Although these findings do not support assumptions from the literature, this study provides baseline data and trends for future study.
