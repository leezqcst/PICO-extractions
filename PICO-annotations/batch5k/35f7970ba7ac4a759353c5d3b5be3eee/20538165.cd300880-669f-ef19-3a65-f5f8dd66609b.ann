T1	Participants 1657 1793	CONCLUSIONS In ACS patients, serial autologous infusions of selective HDL delipidated plasma are clinically feasible and well tolerated.
T2	Participants 1212 1279	RESULTS All reinfusion sessions were tolerated well by all patients
T3	Participants 644 859	METHODS ACS patients undergoing cardiac catheterization with >or=1 nonobstructive native coronary artery atheroma were randomized to either 7 weekly HDL selective delipidated or control plasma apheresis/reinfusions.
T4	Participants 203 421	OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine whether serial autologous infusions of selective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) delipidated plasma are feasible and well tolerated in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
T5	Participants 423 502	BACKGROUND Low HDL is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
