T1	Participants 1656 1834	CONCLUSIONS Treatment with parenteral iron and low-dose rHuEPO-β in bilateral TKRA effectively attenuated anemia and decreased transfusion requirements in iron-deficient patients
T2	Participants 1125 1337	RESULTS Although preoperative Hb and the amount of postoperative bleeding were comparable in the two groups, Hb levels at 1, 2, and 3 days and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperation were significantly higher in Group IE.
T3	Participants 465 784	STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 108 iron-deficient patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group C (control) or Group IE (200 mg of iron sucrose intravenously over 1 hr and 3000 IU of rHuEPO-β subcutaneously during the operation and during the postoperative period if the hemoglobin [Hb] level was 70-80 g/L)
T4	Participants 198 464	BACKGROUND The authors examined the impact of parenteral iron and recombinant human erythropoietin-β (rHuEPO-β) administered in the bilateral total knee replacement arthroplasty (TKRA), on postoperative anemia and transfusion requirements in iron-deficient patients.
