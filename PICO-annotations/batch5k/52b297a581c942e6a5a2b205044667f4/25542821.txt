Efficacy and safety of repeated use of ulipristal acetate in uterine fibroids.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy and safety of repeated 12-week courses of 5 or 10 mg daily of ulipristal acetate for intermittent treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
DESIGN Double-blind, randomized administration of two 12-week courses of ulipristal acetate.
SETTING Gynecology centers.
PATIENT(S) A total of 451 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroid(s) and heavy bleeding.
INTERVENTION(S) Two repeated 12-week treatment courses of daily 5 or 10 mg of ulipristal acetate.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Amenorrhea, controlled bleeding, fibroid volume, quality of life (QoL), pain.
RESULT(S) In the 5- and 10-mg treatment groups (62% and 73% of patients, respectively) achieved amenorrhea during both treatment courses. Proportions of patients achieving controlled bleeding during two treatment courses were >80%. Menstruation resumed after each treatment course and was diminished compared with baseline. After the second treatment course, median reductions from baseline in fibroid volume were 54% and 58% for the patients receiving 5 and 10 mg of ulipristal acetate, respectively. Pain and QoL improved in both groups. Ulipristal acetate was well tolerated with less than 5% of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.
CONCLUSION(S) Repeated 12-week courses of daily oral ulipristal acetate (5 and 10 mg) effectively control bleeding and pain, reduce fibroid volume, and restore QoL in patients with symptomatic fibroids.
