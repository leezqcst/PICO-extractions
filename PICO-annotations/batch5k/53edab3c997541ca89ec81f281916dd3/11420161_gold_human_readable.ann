Forty-three CABG patients were randomised into an ischaemic preconditioning and a control group. The protocol for ischaemic preconditioning was two cycles of 2-min ischaemia followed by 3-min reperfusion. Free radicals were measured using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Global and right heart functions were collected.
