Participants 154 426 5
In previous published work we described 57 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, prospectively randomised to receive either cefotaxime or cephamandole as a single-antibiotic, three-dose, peri-operative prophylaxis against post-operative infective complications.

We describe here our findings in a further 63 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery who were similarly allocated into either a cefotaxime or cephamandole antibiotic group.
