We evaluated the benefits of physiological pacing in the elderly by recruiting 13 subjects > 75 years of age, already fitted with a physiological pacing system. All had been paced for complete or Mobitz II heart block. Double blind cross over study was performed comparing exercise capacity, measuring distance walked on a 6-min walking test and time taken to climb two flights of stairs; and symptoms, evaluated by an activity of daily living questionnaire, in atrioventricular synchronous and ventricular pacing.
