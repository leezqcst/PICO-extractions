T4	Participants 430 461	a positive allosteric modulator
T5	Participants 755 838	patients with negative symptoms who were receiving second generation antipsychotics
T6	Participants 840 930	Forty-three subjects received galantamine and CDP-choline or matching placebos for 16weeks
T7	Participants 1106 1136	Trial completion was high; 79%
T8	Participants 1014 1058	Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
T9	Participants 1319 1372	overall functioning and a test of free verbal recall.
T10	Participants 1443 1482	r gastro-intestinal adverse events (AE)
