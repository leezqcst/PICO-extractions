T1	Participants 0 58	Enhanced baroreceptor control of the cardiovascular system
T2	Participants 62 115	polyunsaturated Fatty acids in heart failure patients
T3	Participants 244 278	polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
T4	Participants 169 240	the hypothesis that, in heart failure patients, dietary supplementation
T5	Participants 499 536	potentiation of arterial baroreflexes
T6	Participants 632 744	Patients with post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction underwent beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP)
T7	Participants 1139 1191	Baseline BP and R-R interval were unaffected by PUFA
T8	Participants 1767 1921	Dietary PUFA supplementation markedly potentiates baroreflex function and enhances heart rate variability in patients with stable congestive heart failure
T9	Participants 1663 1753	increased R-R interval total variance and low-frequency and high-frequency spectral powers
