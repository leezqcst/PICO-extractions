Comparison of active-learning strategies for motivational interviewing skills, knowledge, and confidence in first-year pharmacy students.

OBJECTIVE To compare 3 strategies for pharmacy student learning of motivational interviewing skills, knowledge of motivational interviewing principles, and confidence in and attitudes toward their application.
DESIGN Following a motivational interviewing lecture, first-year students were randomized to perform practice activities (written dialogue, peer role-play, or mock-patient counseling activities). Motivational interviewing skills, knowledge, confidence, and attitudes were measured.
ASSESSMENT All students demonstrated improvement in skills, knowledge, and confidence. Students in the mock-patient counseling group demonstrated significantly better motivational interviewing skills during practice and trended toward higher scores on the summative evaluation. They also demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge compared with that of the written dialogue group during practice. Feedback at the end was generally positive, with students expressing recognition for the value of motivational interviewing.
CONCLUSIONS Students demonstrated their best performance of motivational interviewing during assessments using interactions with mock or standardized patients.
