Investigations into the potential effects of multiple dose ketorolac on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of racemic warfarin.

1. The potential interaction between racemic warfarin given as a 25 mg single oral dose and chronically administered ketorolac was studied in 12 young healthy male volunteers. 2. Ketorolac produced no major change in the pharmacokinetics of (R)- or (S)-warfarin. 3. Ketorolac did not alter the pharmacodynamic profile of racemic warfarin. 4. Ketorolac increased template bleeding time by a factor of 1.35 as compared with placebo. 5. The results suggest that the ketorolac-warfarin interaction is unlikely to be of major clinical significance; however, combined use of ketorolac and warfarin in patients should be undertaken with due caution and appropriate monitoring.
