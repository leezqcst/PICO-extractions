[Effect of zengjing no. 1 capsule on morphology and motility of sperm in patients with oligospermia].

OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of Zengjing Capsule No. 1 (ZJC1) on morphology and motility of sperm in patients with oligospermia (OSM).
METHODS Seventy-two OSM patients were assigned to 2 groups by a randomizing digital table, the treated group and the control group, they were treated respectively by ZJC1 and Wuzi Yanzong Pill (WYP). The changes of density, motility and morphology of sperm in patients before and after 3-month treatment were examined using computerized WLJY-9000 colour semen analysis system with refined Papanicolaou's stain.
RESULTS The density, motility and morphology of sperm were improved and sperm deformity rate was significantly decreased after treatment in both groups (P < 0.01), but the effects in the treated group were better than those in the control group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION ZJC1 can enhance the density and motility of sperm and reduce the sperm deformity rate in patients with OSM.
