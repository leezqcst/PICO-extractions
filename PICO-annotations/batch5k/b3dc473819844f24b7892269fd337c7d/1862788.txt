Comparison of amantadine and desipramine combined with psychotherapy for treatment of cocaine dependence.

We conducted a single-blind, random assignment, placebo-controlled, 12-week comparison of desipramine hydrochloride and amantadine hydrochloride as adjunctive treatments to counseling for cocaine dependence. Subjects were 54 outpatients who met DSM III-R criteria for active cocaine dependence and who completed a minimum of 2 weeks of treatment. Subjects treated with fixed doses of 200 mg/day desipramine (N = 17), 400 mg/day amantadine-placebo (N = 16), and placebo (N = 21) did not differ for lifetime cocaine use, lifetime histories of psychopathology, admission scores on psychometric assessments, and sociodemographics. All treatment groups demonstrated dramatic and persistent decreases in cocaine use, craving for cocaine, and psychiatric symptoms consequent to treatment. Although there was a trend for more dropouts by subjects taking desipramine, there were no significant differences among treatment groups regarding retention in treatment, craving for cocaine, and decreased cocaine use confirmed by urine toxicology. There was a trend for subjects treated with desipramine to maintain longer periods of cocaine abstinence. Mean plasma concentration of desipramine in a subsample of our subjects was less than that recommended for treatment of depression, thus the dosage of desipramine may have been subtherapeutic.
