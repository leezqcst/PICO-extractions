Relief of periorbital pain after acute angle closure glaucoma attack by botulinum toxin type A.

PURPOSE To assess the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection in patients suffering from intractable periorbital pain after acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG).
PATIENTS AND METHODS In this prospective randomized intervention study, 19 patients suffering from periorbital pain after an AACG attack were injected with BoNT-A or placebo for pain relief. Patients were assessed on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90. The main outcomes were mean change of visual analog rating scale (VARS) and index scores measured through a quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D), and changes in the visual analog scale (VAS), all of which were assessed at each visit. A secondary outcome was the frequency and nature of adverse events and the number of patients who withdrew from the study as a result.
RESULTS In the treatment group (n=10), the mean index score of EQ-5D and VAS changed significantly from the placebo group (by 0.299 and 2.61, respectively) from day 2 (P<0.01). The VARS of EQ-5D also disclosed significant changes from day 2 (17, P<0.01). In addition, efficacy was maintained mainly between days 2 and 60 but declined slightly by day 90. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events in the treatment and placebo groups were local tenderness (21%), subcutaneous hemorrhage (10.5%), and conjunctivitis (10.5%). No severe adverse events were reported during the study or follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS BoNT-A is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of periorbital pain after an AACG attack. Its effects may be maintained for 3 months.
