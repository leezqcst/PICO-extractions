A comparative study of administration methods of granisetron injection used to treat nausea/vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy without cisplatin in tumors of hematopoietic organs. Keihanshin Study Group of Hematological Malignancies.

PURPOSE The antiemetic effect of granisetron injection at a dose of 40 microg/kg used in the treatment of nausea/vomiting induced by multidrug combined cancer chemotherapy excluding cisplatin in patients with tumors of hematopoietic organs was evaluated by comparing a 30-min infusion and a slow intravenous injection given over 30 s.
METHODS A two-group random-allocation comparative study was performed with the cooperation of multiple institutions using a central registration system.
RESULTS In the treatment of acute clinical symptoms, appetite was described as "similar to that during good health" by 61.1% of patients (55/93) in the instillation group and by 47.3% (44/93) in the slow injection group, a significant advantage in the infusion group. However, no significant differences in the number of episodes of vomiting, the severity of nausea or clinical efficacy were found. In the final clinical evaluation and assessment of usefulness based on the subjective judgement of physicians throughout the entire therapeutic period, no differences were discernible. No side effects were reported for either method and there was no indication of a sex difference concerning efficacy. However, the efficacy in patients with an anemic tendency was slightly inferior.
CONCLUSIONS The maintenance of appetite during the administration of anticancer drugs is very important to maintain patients' daily activities and quality of life. The present results support the usefulness of infusion of granisetron as an administration method during chemotherapy for malignant hemopathy.
