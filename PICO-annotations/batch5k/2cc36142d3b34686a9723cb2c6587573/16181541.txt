[A clinical study on the effect of Yinxing Damo combined with betahistine hydrochloride injection on vertebral basilar artery ischemic vertigo].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Yinxing Damo (YXDM) combined with Betahistine Hydrochloride Injection (BHI) on vertebra basilar artery ischemic vertigo (VBIV).
METHODS Ninety patients with VBIV were randomly divided into two groups; 45 patients (the treated group) were treated with YXDM and BHI intravenous dripping, once a day for 14 days. Another 45 patients (control group) were treated with Xueshuantong and BHI intravenous dripping, once daily for 14 days. The clinical syndromes and the index of the transcranial Doppler (TCD) and hemorheology were observed.
RESULTS The total effective rate was 100% in the treated group, which was better than that in the control group 90.5%, (P < 0.05). The indexes of TCD and hemorheology in the treated group were obviously improved after treatment, (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION YXDM combined with BHT injection had better effect in treating patients with VBIV is an ideal drug for VBIV.
