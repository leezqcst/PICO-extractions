A double-blind crossover comparison of pindolol, metoprolol, atenolol and labetalol in mild to moderate hypertension.

1 This study was designed to compare in a double-blind randomized crossover trial, atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol and pindolol. Considerable differences in dose (atenolol 138 +/- 13 mg daily; labetalol 308 +/- 34 mg daily; metoprolol 234 +/- 22 mg daily; and pindolol 24 +/-2 mg daily were required to produce similar antihypertensive effects. 3 The overall incidence of side-effects was similar with atenolol, metoprolol and pindolol but was slightly less with labetalol. Sleep disturbances and abnormal dreaming patterns were most frequent with pindolol. 4 There was a significantly greater fall in pulse rate during atenolol and metoprolol treatment periods.
