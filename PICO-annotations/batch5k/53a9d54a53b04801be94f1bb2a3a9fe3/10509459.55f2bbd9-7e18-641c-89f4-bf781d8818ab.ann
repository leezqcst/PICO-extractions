T1	Participants 1617 1729	CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that laparoscopic instruments do, in fact, provide surgeons with haptic feedback
T2	Participants 1209 1400	RESULTS Direct palpation was associated with the highest accuracy for shape identification and was superior to both conventional instruments (p < 0.001) and laparoscopic instruments (p<0.001)
T3	Participants 632 795	This study was designed to determine the ability of experienced surgeons to interpret haptic feedback with respect to texture, shape, and consistency of an object.
T4	Participants 64 165	BACKGROUND The applications of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and laparoscopy are rapidly expanding
T5	Participants 858 962	Twenty surgeons were presented objects in a random order, with participants blinded as to their identity
