Efficacy and safety of de novo or early everolimus with low cyclosporine in deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients at specified risk of delayed graft function: 12-month results of a randomized, multicenter trial.

Immediate or early use of proliferation signal inhibitor (PSI)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy can avoid high exposure to calcineurin inhibitors but concerns exist relating to the risk of delayed graft function (DGF) and impaired wound healing with the mTOR sirolimus. CALLISTO was a 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open-label study. Deceased-donor kidney transplant patients at protocol-specified risk of DGF were randomized to start everolimus on day 1 (immediate everolimus, IE; n = 65) or week 5 (delayed everolimus, DE; n = 74). Incidence of the primary endpoint (biopsy-proven acute rejection, BPAR; graft loss, death, DGF, wound healing complications related to transplant surgery or loss to follow-up) was 64.6% and 66.2% in the IE and DE groups, respectively, at month 12 (P = 0.860). The overall incidence of BPAR was 20.1%. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate was 48 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 49 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the IE and DE groups, respectively, at month 12. DGF and wound healing complications were similar between groups. Adverse events led to study drug discontinuation in 17 IE patients (26.2%) and 28 DE patients (37.8%) (NS). In conclusion, introduction of everolimus immediately or early posttransplant in DGF-risk patients is associated with good efficacy, renal function and safety profile. There seems no benefit in delaying initiation of everolimus.
