T2	Participants 184 248	a double-blind trial of vitamin C versus placebo in 868 children
T3	Participants 250 416	There was no difference in number becoming ill (133 versus 129), number of episodes (166 versus 159) or mean illness duration (5.5 versus 5.8 days) between the groups
T4	Participants 418 614	Children receiving vitamin C had fewer throat cultures yielding beta-hemolytic streptococcus (six versus 13, P less than 0.10), but no difference in overall complicated illness rate (24 versus 25)
T5	Participants 616 764	Plasma ascorbic acid levels were higher in the vitamin group 24 to 26 hours after supplementation (1.28 versus 1.04 mg per 100 ml, P less than 0.01)
T6	Participants 766 912	Children with high plasma ascorbic acid concentrations had longer mean illness (6.8 versus 4.0 days, P less than 0.05) than those with low levels.
