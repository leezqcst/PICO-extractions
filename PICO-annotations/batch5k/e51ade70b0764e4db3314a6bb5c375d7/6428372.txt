Cognitive effects of lithium carbonate and haloperidol in treatment-resistant aggressive children.

The effects of lithium carbonate and haloperidol on cognition were examined in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 61 treatment-resistant, hospitalized school-aged children. They all had a DSM-III diagnosis of conduct disorder-- undersocialized , aggressive, with a profile of highly explosive and aggressive behavior. Children were assessed at the end of a two-week placebo-baseline period and again after four weeks of treatment. Drug effects on cognition were mild. Haloperidol (mean dose, 2.95 mg/day) caused significant decreases in Porteus Maze test quotient scores and a slowing of reaction time (RT) on a simple RT task. Lithium carbonate (mean dose, 1,166 mg/day) adversely affected qualitative scores on the Porteus Maze test. No significant treatment effects were found for the Matching Familiar Figures Test, short-term recognition memory and concept attainment tasks, or the Stroop Test.
