Impact of angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy (olmesartan or valsartan) on coronary atherosclerotic plaque volume measured by intravascular ultrasound in patients with stable angina pectoris.

Coronary plaques can be reduced by some medications. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 angiotensin II receptor blockers (olmesartan at 20 mg/day or valsartan at 80 mg/day) on coronary plaque by coronary intravascular ultrasound. One hundred hypertensive patients with stable angina pectoris who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly selected to receive 1 of the 2 angiotensin II receptor blockers after coronary intervention. Nontarget coronary lesions with mild to moderate stenosis were measured by volumetric intravascular ultrasound at baseline and after 6 months. After 6 months, both the olmesartan and the valsartan groups showed significant reduction of the examined coronary plaque volume (46.2 ± 24.1 mm³ at baseline vs 41.6 ± 21.1 mm³ at 6 months: 4.7% decrease, p = 0.0002; and 47.2 ± 32.7 mm³ at baseline vs 42.5 ± 30.2 mm³ at 6 months: 4.8% decrease, p = 0.002, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference of plaque regression between the 2 groups (p = 0.96). In conclusion, there was a significant decrease from baseline in the coronary plaque volume in patients with stable angina pectoris who received olmesartan or valsartan for 6 months. In addition, there was no significant difference in the reduction of plaque volume achieved by these 2 medications.
