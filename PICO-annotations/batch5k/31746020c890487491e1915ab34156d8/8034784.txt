Effectiveness of a calculus scaling gel.

This study evaluated the effect of a calculus scaling gel (SofScale) on time and ease of the scaling procedure in a double-blind, split-mouth clinical study of 32 subjects. The Volpe-Manhold calculus index was used to quantify the distribution and amount of calculus deposition on the lingual aspect of the mandibular 6 anterior teeth at baseline. The gel was applied directly to the calculus and subgingivally to the area to be scaled. Pre- and post-treatment gingival and stain indices were taken. Operator and subject questionnaires were completed immediately after treatment to determine ease of the scaling procedure. Results were analyzed with paired t-tests. The time difference in scaling between the product and placebo side was not significant. This study found that SofScale is safe to gingival tissues and does not promote tooth sensitivity. However, this study did not find significant differences in scaling time between product and placebo when using a 2-minute gel contact time.
