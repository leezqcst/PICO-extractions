GnRH agonist treatment before total laparoscopic hysterectomy for large uteri.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether uterine shrinkage induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in women with a large uterus (>14 wks) may facilitate total laparoscopic hysterectomy.
DESIGN Randomized, prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification I).
SETTING University-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS Sixty-two women with symptomatic uterine myomas (size 16-20 wks).
INTERVENTIONS Total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign pathology.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Before surgery, women were assigned, at a ratio of 1:1 by random selection, to receive injections of triptorelin depot 11.25 mg 3 months before surgery (group A) or no treatment (group B). Uterine volume, mean operating time, uterine weight, drop in hemoglobin, intraoperative complications, conversions to laparotomy, and hospital stay were recorded. Triptorelin decreased uterine volume, calculated by ultrasonography, by 26.5% in group A, whereas the volume remained unchanged in group B. Statistical differences were found between groups concerning uterine weight, operating time, and drop in hemoglobin level. Three patients in group B were converted to laparotomy because of uterine size.
CONCLUSION In women with a large uterus, a 3-month preoperative course of GnRH may facilitate laparoscopic hysterectomy, decreasing uterine size, operating time, and blood loss.
