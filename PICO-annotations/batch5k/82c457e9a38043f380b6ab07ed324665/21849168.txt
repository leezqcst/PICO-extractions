Effect of gravity on robot-assisted motor training after chronic stroke: a randomized trial.

OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy of 2 distinct 6-week robot-assisted reaching programs compared with an intensive conventional arm exercise program (ICAE) for chronic, stroke-related upper-extremity (UE) impairment. To examine whether the addition of robot-assisted training out of the horizontal plane leads to improved outcomes.
DESIGN Randomized controlled trial, single-blinded, with 12-week follow-up.
SETTING Research setting in a large medical center.
PARTICIPANTS Adults (N=62) with chronic, stroke-related arm weakness stratified by impairment severity using baseline UE motor assessments.
INTERVENTIONS Sixty minutes, 3 times a week for 6 weeks of robot-assisted planar reaching (gravity compensated), combined planar with vertical robot-assisted reaching, or intensive conventional arm exercise program.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE UE Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) mean change from baseline to final training.
RESULTS All groups showed modest gains in the FMA from baseline to final with no significant between group differences. Most change occurred in the planar robot group (mean change ± SD, 2.94 ± 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-4.47). Participants with greater motor impairment (n=41) demonstrated a larger difference in response (mean change ± SD, 2.29 ± 0.72; 95% CI, 0.85-3.72) for planar robot-assisted exercise compared with the intensive conventional arm exercise program (mean change ± SD, 0.43 ± 0.72; 95% CI, -1.00 to 1.86).
CONCLUSIONS Chronic UE deficits because of stroke are responsive to intensive motor task training. However, training outside the horizontal plane in a gravity present environment using a combination of vertical with planar robots was not superior to training with the planar robot alone.
