Carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus carboplatin and paclitaxel in very platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients: results from a subset analysis of the CALYPSO phase III trial.

AIM To perform a subset analysis of patients with very platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) enrolled in the phase III CALYPSO trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS The international non-inferiority trial enrolled women with ROC that relapsed >6 months following first- or second-line platinum- and paclitaxel-based therapies. Patients were randomised to CD [carboplatin-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)] or CP (carboplatin-paclitaxel) and stratified by treatment-free interval (TFI). In this analysis, patients with a TFI>24 months were analysed separately for progression free survival (PFS), the primary endpoint of CALYPSO, overall survival (OS) and safety.
RESULTS A total of 259 very platinum-sensitive patients were included (n=131, CD; n=128, CP). Median PFS was 12.0 months for the CD arm and 12.3 months for CP [HR=1.05 (95% CI, 0.79-1.40); P=0.73 for superiority] and median OS was 40.2 months for CD and 43.9 for CP [HR=1.18 (95% CI 0.85-1.63); P=0.33 for superiority]. Overall response rates were 42% and 38%, respectively (P=0.46). Toxicities were more common with CP versus CD, including grade 3/4 neutropenia (40.8% versus 27.5%; P=0.025), nausea (4.8% versus 3.1%; P=0.47), allergic reaction (8% versus 3.1%; P=0.082) sensory neuropathy (4.8% versus 2.3%; P=0.27) and grade 2 alopecia (88% versus 9.2%; P<0.001). Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (12.2% versus 3.2%; P=0.007) and mucositis (2.3% versus 0%; P=0.089) were more common with CD. Grade 3/4 hand-foot syndrome occurred rarely with CD (3 patients versus 0 in CP arm; P=0.089).
CONCLUSION CP and CD were equally effective treatment regimens for patients with very platinum-sensitive ROC. The favourable risk-benefit profile suggests carboplatin-PLD as treatment of choice for these patients.
