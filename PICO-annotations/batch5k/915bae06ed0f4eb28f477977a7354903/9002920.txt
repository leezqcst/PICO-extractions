Chlorhexidine swabbing applications under various conditions of use in preventive oral care for persons with disabilities.

A sample of 44 adults with severe disabilities completed a randomized single-blind cross-over study testing chlorhexidine swabbing under various conditions: with/without prior dental prophylaxis, reduced frequency of application (2 vs. 5 times per week), and prolonged use (42 weeks). All subjects received therapeutic doses of 10 mL 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex, Procter & Gamble) and 10 mL 0.05% NaF applied with a Toothette (Sage Products). Clinical effectiveness of chlorhexidine swabbing compared with placebo was previously reported. In the present study, while initial benefits were observed to be independent of dental prophylaxis, significant reductions in periodontal scores were sustained by a combination of dental prophylaxis and swabbing protocol, at reduced frequency of application and over prolonged time. High levels of acceptance and compliance by subjects/caregivers were maintained. Subjects/caregivers reported improvements in dental health as well as in attitude, quality of life, and smile. Chlorhexidine swabbing at maintenance frequency, combined with periodic dental prophylaxis, may offer an effective and pragmatic long-term preventive regimen for persons with disabilities.
