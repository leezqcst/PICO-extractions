Effects of omeprazole and amoxycillin on the human oral and gastrointestinal microflora in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.

Fourteen patients with Helicobacter pylori infection were treated with omeprazole capsules 20 mg and amoxycillin capsules 1000 mg twice daily for 14 days and 14 patients with omeprazole capsules 20 mg and placebo twice daily for 14 days. Samples from saliva, dental plaque and faeces and biopsies from antrum and corpus were analysed in order to determine the ecological changes in the normal microflora. Several microorganisms were affected by both treatment regimens. Two patients were colonised with enterobacteria in the oral cavity and stomach during the omeprazole plus amoxycillin treatment. A general increase in the number of microorganisms from gastric mucosa was observed in both treatment groups. A selection of resistant enterobacteria and an increase in beta-lactamase production was observed in the faecal samples during the omeprazole plus amoxycillin treatment. Eradication of H. pylori in the omeprazole-amoxycillin group was 50% and in the omeprazole placebo group 0% four weeks after treatment. No viable H. pylori were cultivated in the saliva, dental plaque or faecal samples. Treatment with omeprazole 20 mg and amoxycillin 1000 mg twice daily for 14 days altered the normal microflora in the oral, gastric and intestinal tract and antibiotic resistant microorganisms increased in numbers in the intestinal microflora.
