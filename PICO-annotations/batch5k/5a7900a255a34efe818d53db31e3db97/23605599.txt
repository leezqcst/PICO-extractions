Evaluation of the effect of low level laser on prevention of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

Radiotherapy in the head and neck region and chemotherapy might give rise to oral mucositis which is a severe and painful inflammation. There is no known definite cure for mucositis. A number of studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of low-power laser on radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced mucositis. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of low-power laser on the prevention of mucositis, xerostomia and pain as a result of chemotherapy. The subjects in this double-blind randomized controlled study were 24 adult patients who underwent chemotherapy during 2009-2010. The results showed that low-power laser was able to decrease the effect of chemotherapy on oral mucositis, xerostomia and pain in a variety of malignancies (P&lt;0.05). It can be concluded that low-power laser might decrease the intensity of mucositis.
