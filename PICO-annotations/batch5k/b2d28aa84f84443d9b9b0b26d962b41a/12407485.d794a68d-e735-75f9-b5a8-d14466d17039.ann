T1	Participants 1565 1826	CONCLUSION Patients who experience virologic suppression with a regimen of lamivudine 150 mg BID in combination with stavudine/PI can maintain that suppression by continuing their regimen or switching to lamivudine 300 mg QD and continuing the other components.
T2	Participants 899 997	ESULTS A high rate of virologic suppression was sustained with both regimens throughout the trial.
T3	Participants 513 751	METHOD Eighty-nine suppressed patients > or =18 years old with CD4 counts >50 cells/mm(3) were enrolled in this phase II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, stratified (by pretrial protease inhibitor [PI]), parallel-group clinical trial
T4	Participants 125 511	PURPOSE To compare the efficacy (sustained virologic suppression) and safety/tolerability of a switch to lamivudine 300 mg once daily (QD) versus continued lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (BID) in virologically suppressed patients (HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL for > or =3 months) on stable (> or =6 months) therapy with lamivudine 150 mg BID plus stavudine and either indinavir or nelfinavir
