Participants 471 888 9
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized and crossover design, nine female and three male healthy subjects (age 34 (sd 11) years, BMI 24.5 (sd 2.5) kg/m(2)) with a preference for a high-fat diet ingested ENT (3 x 15 mg/d) or placebo (PLA) while consuming a high-fat diet ad libitum for 4 d. Eight subjects ended each intervention with a 36 h stay in the respiration chamber, continuing the diet and treatment

We conclude that oral ENT administration did not affect food intake, energy expenditure or body weight in subjects with a preference for a high-fat diet experiencing a negative energy and fat balance
