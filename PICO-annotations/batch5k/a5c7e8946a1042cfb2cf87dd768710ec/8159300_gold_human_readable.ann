Seventy-three patients with steroid-sensitive idiopathic NS admitted to the study were randomly assigned to cyclophosphamide (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks or CsA (5 mg/kg/day in adults, 6 mg/kg/day in children) for 9 months, tapered off by 25% every month until complete discontinuation at month 12. Seven patients lost to follow up were not considered in the analysis. The remaining 66 patients were followed up for 3-24 months after randomization.
