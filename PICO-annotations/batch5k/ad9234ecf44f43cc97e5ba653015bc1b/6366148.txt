The treatment of localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children: a report from the Children's Cancer Study Group.

Investigators of the Children's Cancer Study Group entered 73 children with previously untreated localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on a prospective randomized trial of systemic treatment with either a four-drug program (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, prednisone [COMP]) or a 10-drug (LSA2-L2 modified) program of 18 months duration. All patients received central nervous system prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate and most received local or regional radiation treatment. The three-year relapse-free survival rate for all patients (N = 73) was 84%; for COMP (N = 42) was 85%, and for LSA2-L2 (N = 31) was 84%. Of the 12 patients who suffered adverse events eight relapsed and four died of toxicity. Histopathology was reviewed centrally. Of 32 patients with nonlymphoblastic disease treated with COMP only one relapsed. Of 26 patients treated with LSA2-L2, four relapsed. Patients with localized lymphoblastic disease were uncommon. None of three patients treated with LSA2-L2 relapsed compared with three of nine treated with COMP. COMP is an excellent treatment for patients with localized disease of nonlymphoblastic type, but the relative value of the two regimens for patients with localized lymphoblastic disease is uncertain.
