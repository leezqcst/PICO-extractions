Humoral immune response to tetanus-diphtheria vaccine given during extended use of chloroquine or primaquine malaria chemoprophylaxis.

Immune suppression resulting from prolonged chemoprophylaxis and potential drug-vaccine interaction were investigated within the context of a randomized placebo-controlled trial that compared daily primaquine or weekly chloroquine administration for malaria prevention. After 11 months of prophylaxis, adult male subjects received a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccination. Prophylaxis continued 4 weeks longer. Anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria antibody levels were measured by ELISA at baseline and at 1, 3, 7, and 14 months after Td vaccination. All groups were comparable at baseline. Immunization triggered significant increases in anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria IgG levels over each group's pre-Td baseline levels and those of an unvaccinated control group. Geometric mean anti-tetanus titers (GMTs) in the primaquine group were significantly higher than those of the placebo group at 1, 3, and 14 months. Anti-tetanus GMTs in placebo and chloroquine groups declined over 14 months to levels comparable to those of unvaccinated controls, but levels in the primaquine group remained significantly higher than in controls.
