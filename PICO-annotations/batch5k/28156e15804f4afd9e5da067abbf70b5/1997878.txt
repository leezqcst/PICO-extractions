Sinemet CR in Parkinson's disease.

Sinemet CR, a controlled release carbidopa/levodopa preparation, was compared to conventional carbidopa/levodopa in a double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Comparable clinical benefits and adverse effects were noted with the two medications. However significantly less frequent dosing was necessary with Sinemet CR.
