[Clinical application of irradiated drug-containing porcine-cornea to patients with ocular burns].

OBJECTIVE To explore a new method for the management of patients with ocular burns.
METHODS Fifty-five cases of patients with ocular burns (in 88 eyes) were randomly divided into treatment and control groups. Thirty cases in treatment group with 49 eyes were transplanted with irradiated drug-containing (ofloxacin, acetyl cysteine and reduced glutathione) porcine-cornea. 25 cases in control group with 39 eyes were treated with routine program.
RESULTS Thirty-two eyes were rescued in treatment group with the cure rate of 65.3%. But only 17 eyes were saved in control group with the cure rate of 43.59%, indicating significant difference of the cure rate between the two groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION Irradiated drug-containing porcine-cornea might well be an ideal therapeutic material for the management of patients with ocular burns.
