Iloprost in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.

The inhibition of platelet aggregation during cardiopulmonary bypass and effects on post-operative placebo-controlled study of 145 patients. Significant preservation of platelet numbers and function were shown without significant haemodynamic problems, but no effect on cerebral deficits could be found. The use of iloprost in patients with severe thrombocytopenia seems justified, but the clinical benefits from its use in routine cardiopulmonary bypass remain to be shown.
