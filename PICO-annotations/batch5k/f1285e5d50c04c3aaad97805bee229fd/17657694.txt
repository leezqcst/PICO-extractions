[Potentials of monocular augmented reality technology in automobile production].

INTRODUCTION Augmented reality (AR) technologies can enrich the real environment with visual data, which has potential benefits for optimising the operator's working process. It offers the possibility to provide context-sensitive information independently of the user's location and position. Data are presented to the dominant eye on a semi-transparent mirror using a head-mounted display (HMD) unit that works with retinal laser technology. In this study the potential benefits and drawbacks of this new AR technology were evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 45 participants without any visual impairment were randomly assigned to 3 groups and completed a variety of tasks during a simulated working day. Group 1 received conventional working aids (paper-based documents) to support the task processing. Group 2 additionally wore an HMD unit that was switched off. Group 3 wore a functioning HMD without any additional aids. Evaluation was carried out by means of a standardised questionnaire (BMS) and a concentration test ("d2 Aufmerksamkeits-Belastungs-Test").
RESULTS No significant differences between the 3 groups were found in terms of mental strain, concentration-test performance and physical or mental complaints reported in a follow-up interview. Around 20 % of the subjects noticed a higher pressure and blurred vision in both eyes as well as headaches. Half of the participants complained about deficiencies concerning the ergonomic hardware design of the AR system.
DISCUSSION Changes in objective ophthalmological investigation parameters were not observed. Subjects reported reduced acceptance of the HMD based on non-ophthalmological reasons, for example, the weight of the unit or the length of the cable. However, for some specific working tasks, advantages in process optimisation and operator support were observed.
