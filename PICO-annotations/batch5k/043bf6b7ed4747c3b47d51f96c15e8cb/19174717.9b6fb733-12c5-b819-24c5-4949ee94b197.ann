T1	Participants 1426 1516	CONCLUSION Intravitreal bevacizumab injection improves BCVA and reduces CMT more than GLP.
T2	Participants 861 1030	RESULTS Baseline BCVA (logMAR) and CMT were, respectively, 0.89 +/- 0.13 and 650 +/- 140 microm for the GLP group, 0.87 +/- 0.16 and 690 +/- 120 microm for the IB group.
T3	Participants 341 545	METHODS Thirty eyes of 30 consecutive patients with cystoid macular edema secondary to nonischemic branch retinal vein occlusion were assigned to either GLP group or to intravitreal bevacizumab (IB) group
T4	Participants 123 339	INTRODUCTION To evaluate the outcome of cystoid macular edema treated with intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and macular grid laser photocoagulation (GLP), in patients with perfused branch retinal vein occlusion
