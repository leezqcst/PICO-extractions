Effects of supervised exercise therapy in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer.

PURPOSE Postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer has a number of associated complications. This study examined whether supervised moderate-intensity exercise could mitigate the complications that occur during radiotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty women were randomized before radiotherapy after various operations for breast cancer. Seventeen patients who were assigned to the exercise group performed supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy for 50 min 3 times per week for 5 weeks. Twenty-three patients in the control group were asked to perform self-shoulder stretching exercise. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), brief fatigue inventory (BFI), range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder, and pain score were assessed before and after radiotherapy.
RESULTS There were no significant differences noted at baseline between groups. In the exercise group, there was an increase in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and decrease in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients in the control group showed decrease in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and increase in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. There were statistically significant differences in the changes in the WHOQOL, BFI, shoulder ROM, and pain score between the groups.
CONCLUSION Patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer may benefit in physical and psychological aspects from supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy.
