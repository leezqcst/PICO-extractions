The efficacy and safety of simultaneous transurethral GreenLight photoselective vaporization of bladder tumor and prostate in patients with bladder tumor and lower urinary tract symptoms.

PURPOSE We compared the safety and efficacy of simultaneous transurethral GreenLight photoselective vaporization of bladder tumor and prostate (PVBT/PVP) in patients with bladder tumor and bladder outlet obstruction caused by benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).
METHODS Sixty-two patients with bladder tumor were enrolled in our prospective and randomized trial. A total of 37 men underwent simultaneous transurethral PVBT/PVP, and 25 patients underwent PVBT alone. The clinicopathological parameters and the recurrence of bladder tumor on the bladder neck/prostatic fossa were evaluated in all patients.
RESULTS Clinicopathological parameters of both groups were similar. The rates of recurrence, progression and tumor recurrence of bladder neck/prostatic fossa were 16.0, 4.0 and 4.0 % in the simultaneous resection group, and 18.9, 5.4 and 8.1 % in the group PVBT, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous PVBT/PVP may help decrease the overall recurrence rate and tumor recurrence in bladder neck/prostatic fossa. PVBT/PVP can be performed effectively and safely in patients with bladder tumor and BPH.
