T1	Participants 477 1029	Patients with monolateral postmastectomy lymphedema were randomized to receive two cycles of intermittent pneumatic compression (PC group), i.e., five two-hour sessions per week for two weeks, to be repeated after a five-week interval, or to no treatment (control group). The patients in both groups were instructed as to the prophylactic hygienic care of the limb. Lymphedema was assessed by the sum of differences in circumference measurements between affected and normal limbs ('delta'). Response was defined as a > or = 25% reduction in delta value
