White coat effect detected using self-monitoring of blood pressure at home: comparison with ambulatory blood pressure.

The objective of the study was to investigate whether home blood pressure (HBP) is a reliable alternative to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) for the detection of the white coat effect (WCE). Hypertensive patients were randomized to measure HBP for 2 weeks or ABP for 24 h. The alternative measurement was then performed. Clinic blood pressure (CBP) was measured in the beginning and end of the study. Subjects with a difference of > or = 20 mm Hg systolic or > or = 10 mm Hg diastolic BP between CBP and awake ABP or CBP and HBP, were classified as clinic reactors. A total of 189 patients completed the study (79 on stable antihypertensive treatment). There was no difference in the magnitude of WCE assessed using the ABP or the HBP method (mean discrepancy, systolic BP: -1.5 +/- 11.7 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.2, 0.2; diastolic BP: 0.9 +/- 7.0, 95% CI -0.1, 1.9). A strong association existed between WCE calculated using the HBP or the ABP method (r = 0.64/0.59 systolic/diastolic, P < .001). The proportion of patients classified as clinic reactors was identical using the HBP or the ABP method (25.9%). Agreement between methods in the classification of clinic reactors was found in 147 patients (78%). The sensitivity and specificity of the HBP method to classify correctly clinic reactors (ABP method used as the standard) were 57% and 85%, respectively, whereas its positive and negative predictive value were 57% and 85%. These results indicate that HBP is not appropriate as an alternative to ABP diagnostic testing in the detection of WCE. Nevertheless, HBP appears useful as a screening test for the detection of this phenomenon.
