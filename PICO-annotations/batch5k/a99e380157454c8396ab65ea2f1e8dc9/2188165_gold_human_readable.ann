During hypertensive crises (systolic blood pressure exceeding 200 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure exceeding 115 mmHg) forty hypertensive patients received either 25 mg of SLC or 10 mg of SLN in a randomized single blind fashion. Blood pressure and heart rate were then controlled after 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120 min. and, in 18 cases, up to the 8th hour from the administration.
