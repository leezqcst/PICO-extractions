T1	Participants 1163 1429	Gastric compliance derived from isobaric distension rose in a dose related manner (42.6 (5.5) and 63.6 (7.7) v 27.0 (3.5) ml/mm Hg; p=0.0004) with a concomitant reduction of the pressure at half maximum bag volume (6.4 (0.4) and 5.5 (0.4) v 7.2 (0.1) mm Hg; p<0.0001
T2	Participants 1568 1654	CONCLUSIONS GLP-1 is a candidate physiological inhibitory regulator of fundus motility
T3	Participants 447 558	METHODS Background infusions were saline, or GLP-1 at 0.3 or 0.9 pmol/ kg/min on separate days in random order.
T4	Participants 836 956	RESULTS Low and high loads of GLP-1 induced physiological and supraphysiological plasma immunoreactivities, respectively
T5	Participants 406 445	SUBJECTS Eleven healthy male volunteers
T6	Participants 269 404	AIMS To assess the effects of synthetic GLP-1 on fundus tone and volume waves, gastric compliance, and perception of gastric distension
