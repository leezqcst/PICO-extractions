T1	Participants 1835 1903	CONCLUSIONS Magnesium significantly reduced the shivering threshold.
T2	Participants 1484 1595	RESULTS Magnesium reduced the shivering threshold (36.3 [SD 0.4] degrees C vs 36.6 [0.3] degrees C, P = 0.040).
T3	Participants 644 823	METHODS We studied nine healthy male volunteers (18-40 yr) on two randomly assigned treatment days: (1) control and (2) magnesium (80 mg kg(-1) followed by infusion at 2 g h(-1)).
T4	Participants 77 305	BACKGROUND Hypothermia may be an effective treatment for stroke or acute myocardial infarction; however, it provokes vigorous shivering, which causes potentially dangerous haemodynamic responses and prevents further hypothermia.
