T1	Participants 126 181	patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer
T2	Participants 265 450	74 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer were randomized to either intra-arterial hepatic artery infusion with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or systemic chemotherapy with 5-FU
T3	Participants 455 606	61 acceptable patients, there was no significant difference in terms of response rate, time to progression, duration of the response, and survival rate
T4	Participants 619 750	response rate for the intra-arterial infusion arm was slightly higher than for the systemic arm, the difference was not significant
T5	Participants 760 857	intra-arterial infusion arm was associated with a greater incidence of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
T6	Participants 859 1018	in addition to complications of femoral-arterial thrombosis, bleeding, and infection at the catheter site not seen in patients treated by systemic chemotherapy
T7	Participants 1020 1139	Patients with an objective response to chemotherapy on either treatment arm survived twice as long as the nonresponders
T8	Participants 1141 1251	Long-term survival in one patient, 77 months, can occasionally be achieved in patients with hepatic metastases
