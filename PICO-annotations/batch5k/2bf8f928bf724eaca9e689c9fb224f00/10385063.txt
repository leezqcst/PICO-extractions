Calcitriol for bone disease in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

BACKGROUND Osteoporosis is associated with cirrhosis of the liver, but the effects of therapy for osteoporosis associated with cirrhosis are still controversial.
METHODS We evaluated the effects of calcitriol (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) on bone mineral density (BMD) in 76 patients (26 men and 50 women) with cirrhosis who were assigned randomly to receive calcitriol (0.5 mg twice per day) or not. The BMD of the lumbar vertebrae was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at least twice, 12-57 months apart.
RESULTS For men, the mean annual change in BMD was 1.1% in the treated group and -0.4% in the control group. The median (25th and 75th percentiles) annual change in BMD was 0.6 (-0.1, 2.1%) in the treated group and -1.4 (-1.9, 1.6%) in the control group. The difference in the median annual change between the two groups was significant (P = 0.013). For women, the mean annual change in BMD was -0.5% in the treated group and -2.3% in the control group. The median (25th and 75th percentiles) annual change in BMD was -0.5 (-1.8, 1.3%) in the treated group and -1.5 (-3.8, -0.7%) in the control group. This difference was significant (P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that calcitriol can prevent bone loss and, therefore, may be useful for the treatment of bone disease in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
