T1	Participants 386 484	Ten healthy volunteers, and seven with UC in symptomatic remission took part; all were non-smokers
T2	Participants 486 592	All 17 subjects were given nicotine or placebo solution on two separate occasions in a randomized sequence
T3	Participants 1033 1108	in three patients with UC, the low-frequency activity was of high amplitude
T4	Participants 939 1032	Baseline spontaneous activity in all subjects showed both high- and low-frequency components;
T5	Participants 1110 1170	The nicotine reduced both tone and activity in all subjects,
T6	Participants 1232 1375	Tone in all 17 subjects was reduced significantly at 3 min after nicotine (P = 0.000015, sign test); the rate of recovery varied in individuals
T7	Participants 1543 1709	Intra-luminal nicotine significantly reduces both smooth muscle tone and contractile activity in the recto-sigmoid colon in both normal subjects and patients with UC.
