T1	Participants 356 532	Fifteen patients with mouth leak complaining of mouth dryness and nasal obstruction underwent two consecutive overnight polysomnographies, one with a chinstrap, in random order
T2	Participants 534 614	Cephalometry with and without a chinstrap was randomly performed on six patients
