[Complaints in the postoperative phase related to anesthetics].

In two prospective, randomized studies the frequency of headache, nausea, vomiting, and analgesic requirement during the first postoperative 24 h was observed in order to study differences between the sexes and the inhalation anesthetics halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, or balanced anesthesia with enflurane/alfentanil. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent after enflurane than after halothane or isoflurane. There was no significant difference between anesthetics and frequency of headache, but there were significant differences in postoperative analgesic requirements which were highest after halothane and lowest after isoflurane. Postoperative complaints were always significantly greater among women than among men. The second study indicated that balanced anesthesia did not reduce the analgesic requirement compared to enflurane without alfentanil, but lead to a higher incidence of vomiting. After premedication with flunitrazepam and atropine and combined with 70% N2O/30% O2, isoflurane was the most favorable anesthetic agent with regard to the parameters studied. Balanced anesthesia with enflurane/alfentanil did not show any advantages for patients in the postoperative phase under the given conditions.
