The study of inhibiting systematic inflammatory response syndrome by applying xenogenic (porcine) acellular dermal matrix on second-degree burns.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the influence of xenogenic (porcine) acellular dermal matrix on the systematic inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS), and the reaction of burn patients to tissue damage upon application to second-degree burn wounds.
METHOD Seventy-two cases of patients with acute second-degree burns were enrolled in the study. According to the total burn surface area (TBSA) and the treatment methods, we randomly divided the patients into four groups. Group A (treatment group): patients with less than 30% TBSA covered with xenogenic acellular dermal matrix. Group B (control group): patients with less than 30% TBSA covered with betadine ointment gauzes. Group C (treatment group): patients with more than 30% TBSA covered with porcine acellular dermal matrix. Group D (control group): patients with more than 30% TBSA covered with betadine ointment gauzes. Serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by single radial immunodiffusion method on 1, 4, 7 and 14 days postburn.
RESULTS The serum level of CRP in group A was significantly less than that of in group B (P<0.05) on days 4, 7 and 14. The serum level of CRP in group C increased slowly, descended quickly and was significantly less than that of in group D on days 4, 7 and 14.
CONCLUSION The application of xenogenic (porcine) acellular dermal matrix on second-degree burn wound can decrease serum level of CRP of the patients, which may play an important role in reducing SIRS and sepsis incidence.
