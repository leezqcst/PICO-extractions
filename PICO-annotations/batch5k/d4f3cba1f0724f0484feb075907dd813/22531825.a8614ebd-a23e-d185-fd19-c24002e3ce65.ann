T1	Participants 594 1039	Three groups of unimpaired participants trained with the target arm movement broken down in three ways: 1) elbow flexion/extension and the unified shoulder motion independently ("anatomical" decomposition), 2) three component shoulder motions in Euler coordinates and elbow flexion/extension ("Euler" decomposition), or 3) the motion of the tip of the elbow and motion of the hand with respect to the elbow, independently ("visual" decomposition
