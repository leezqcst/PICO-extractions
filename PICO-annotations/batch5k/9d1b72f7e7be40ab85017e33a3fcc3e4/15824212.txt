Simvastatin blunts endotoxin-induced tissue factor in vivo.

BACKGROUND Beyond lipid lowering, various antiinflammatory properties have been ascribed to statins. Moreover, in vitro studies have suggested the presence of anticoagulant effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) was suppressed. In this study, we examined the role of statins in experimental endotoxemia on inflammatory and procoagulant responses in vivo.
METHODS AND RESULTS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 20 healthy, male subjects were randomized to receive either simvastatin (80 mg/d) or placebo for 4 days before intravenous administration of LPS (20 IU/kg IV). Plasma high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), sCD40L, sCD40, and prothrombin fragment F1+2 (F1.2) were determined by ELISAs at baseline and at 4 and 8 hours after LPS administration. Monocyte TF expression and monocyte-platelet aggregates were measured by whole-blood flow cytometry over the same time course. The increases in hsCRP and MCP-1, both known inducers of TF, were significantly suppressed by statin treatment after LPS challenge. Statin premedication blunted the increase of monocyte TF expression in response to LPS. In parallel, endotoxin-induced formation of F1.2 was significantly reduced by simvastatin after 4 and 8 hours. LPS infusion affected neither the formation and activation of monocyte-platelet aggregates nor plasma levels of sCD40 and sCD40L.
CONCLUSIONS Simvastatin suppresses the inflammatory response to endotoxin and blunts monocyte TF expression but does not affect platelet activation.
