This study presents the preliminary results of a randomized prospective two-arm study in which bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) RIVM, a Dutch BCG preparation, is compared with mitomycin C (MMC) in patients with primary or recurrent superficial bladder tumors, including carcinoma in situ (CIS). Therapeutic regimens were as follows: after complete transurethral resection of all visible tumors, BCG RIVM (1 x 10(9) bacilli in 50 mL saline) was instilled once a week for six consecutive weeks, and mitomycin C (30 mg in 50 mL saline) was administered once a week for one month (weeks 1 to 4) and thereafter once a month for a total of six months. Reported are the incidence of side effects in 165 patients and the recurrence rate of tumors in 308 patients after a follow-up period of twelve months
