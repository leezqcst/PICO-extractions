patients with limb ischaemia by autologous transplantation of bone-marrow cells
Participants 360 527 4
We investigated efficacy and safety of autologous implantation of bone marrow-mononuclear cells in patients with ischaemic limbs because of peripheral arterial disease
Participants 537 771 6
We first did a pilot study, in which 25 patients (group A) with unilateral ischaemia of the leg were injected with bone marrow-mononuclear cells into the gastrocnemius of the ischaemic limb and with saline into the less ischaemic limb
Participants 773 980 6
We then recruited 22 patients (group B) with bilateral leg ischaemia, who were randomly injected with bone marrow-mononuclear cells in one leg and peripheral blood-mononuclear cells in the other as a control
Participants 1132 1191 5
Two patients were excluded from group B after randomisation
Participants 1193 1255 3
At 4 weeks in group B patients, ABI was significantly improved
Participants 1659 1710 5
Similar improvements were seen in group A patients.
Participants 1711 1790 3
Two patients in group A died after myocardial infarction unrelated to treatment
