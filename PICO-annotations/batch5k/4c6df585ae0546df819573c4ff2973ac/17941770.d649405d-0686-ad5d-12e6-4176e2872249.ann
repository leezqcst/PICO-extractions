T1	Participants 283 396	48 patients were randomized to either an 18F Re-entry nephrostomy tube (group 1) or a 6F Double-J stent (group 2)
T2	Participants 398 514	The two groups were well matched for age, sex, stone size, stone laterality, and number of previous renal procedures
T3	Participants 572 823	Postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores at 8 and 24 hours and 14 days after surgery, in-hospital analgesic use, length of hospital stay, success rate, blood transfusion rate, and postoperative complications were compared for the two groups
T4	Participants 833 922	The mean hospital stays in groups 1 and 2 were 3.1 and 1.6 days, respectively (P = 0.003)
T5	Participants 924 1633	The mean VAS scores 8 and 24 hours after surgery were significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (P = 0.001). The postoperative analgesic requirement (diclofenac sodium) was significantly higher in group 1 (263 mg) than in group 2 (120 mg; P = 0.02). The rate of blood transfusion in the two groups was similar (P = NS). There was no difference between the groups in VAS scores on postoperative day 14. The number of supracostal accesses was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (P = 0.02). The stone-free rates and the numbers of patients with insignificant residual fragments were similar in the two groups. There was no urine leakage or formation of urinoma in patients with Double-J stents.
