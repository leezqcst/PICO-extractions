Effect of the motilin agonist KC 11458 on gastric emptying in diabetic gastroparesis.

BACKGROUND KC 11458, a motilin agonist without antibiotic properties, accelerates gastric emptying in animals and healthy humans.
AIM To evaluate the acute effects of KC 11458 on gastric emptying in diabetic gastroparesis.
METHODS Twenty-nine patients (6 type 1 and 23 type 2) with gastroparesis underwent assessments of: (i) gastric emptying of a solid/liquid meal using scintigraphy, (ii) glycaemic control (blood glucose at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min during the gastric emptying measurement) and (iii) upper gastrointestinal and 'meal-related' symptoms (questionnaire), at baseline and after treatment with KC 11458 in a dose of 8 mg t.d.s., or placebo for 8 days.
RESULTS KC 11458 had no statistically significant or clinically relevant effect on gastric emptying of either the solid intragastric retention at 100 min (T100) (P = 0.87) or liquid 50% emptying time (T50) (P = 0.17) components of the meal. KC 11458 slightly worsened (P = 0.04) upper gastrointestinal symptoms when compared with placebo. The magnitude of the change in solid gastric emptying correlated with the change in the blood glucose concentration (r = 0.49; P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS KC 11458, in a dose of 8 mg t.d.s. for 8 days, does not accelerate gastric emptying in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. The absence of efficacy may relate to an effect of hyperglycaemia.
