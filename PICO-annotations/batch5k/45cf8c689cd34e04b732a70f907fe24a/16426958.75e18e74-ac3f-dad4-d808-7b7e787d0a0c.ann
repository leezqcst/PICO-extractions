T2	Participants 0 100;102 301	Effect of micronutrient supplement on health and nutritional status of schoolchildren: study design. OBJECTIVE We tested the hypothesis that supplementation with a micronutrient-fortified beverage improves micronutrient status and physical and mental development in apparently healthy schoolchildren.
T3	Participants 302 536	METHODS The study was carried out in middle-income students in two residential schools that catered to children from a semi-urban population near Hyderabad, India. Included were 869 children who were 6 to 16 y of age in grades 1 to 10
T4	Participants 538 696	Because children at each grade were distributed across two classrooms (clusters) and were homogeneous, each grade was considered to consist of a matched pair.
T5	Participants 747 871	Classes in each grade were randomized to receive a micronutrient-enriched beverage or a placebo without added micronutrients
T6	Participants 1522 1657	S Designing an intervention, choosing outcome variables, and implementing the protocol in a typical Indian school setting were achieved
T7	Participants 1136 1315	The number of matched pairs varied between seven and eight, and the required number of children per treatment group ranged from 32 in the case of bone heath to 177 for body weight
