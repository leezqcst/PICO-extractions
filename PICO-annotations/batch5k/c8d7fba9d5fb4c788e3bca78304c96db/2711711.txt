[Dose-reduced antihypertensive agents--use in complex nonmedicamentous therapy of hypertension].

In order to estimate the influence of a non-medicamentous therapy (CNT) on the consumption of medicaments and coronary risk in high blood pressure 73 hypertensives of a medicamentously stabilized CNT-group were examined in comparison to a group of the same size of patients with hypertension who were managed exclusively medicamentously for behaviour of blood pressure, need of antihypertensive drugs and changes of hypertension-associated risk factors. After an exactly controlled 6-month treatment hypertensives with additionally recommended far-reaching CNT showed an economization of medicaments by scarcely the half in comparison to the reference group. By means of suitable control methods a causal non-medicamentously conditioned decrease of blood pressure could be excluded. A different need of antihypertensive drugs was simulated by the exacter intake of medicaments in the index-patients. Notwithstanding the metabolic effects of the additional therapy have induced a positive change of atherogenic lipids. The examinations indicate in general the difficulty of the judgement of efficacy of non-medicamentous therapeutic measures in connection with a rational dose-reduced long-term therapy with antihypertensive drugs.
