T1	Participants 1971 2201	CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the intraoperative use of remifentanil in the rat reduces the MAC of isoflurane, and that this anaesthetic sparing effect is dose-dependent and similar to that produced by fentanyl at the doses tested.
T2	Participants 478 604	MATERIAL AND METHODS For all treatment groups anaesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane in oxygen using an induction chamber.
T3	Participants 66 373	OBJECTIVE The main objective of the study was to determine the effects of three different infusion rates of fentanyl and remifentanil on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane in the rat. A secondary objective was to assess the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of the two opioid drugs.
T4	Participants 1407 1659	RESULTS Fentanyl (15, 30, 60 micro g kg-1 hour-1) and remifentanil (60, 120, 240 micro g kg-1 hour-1) similarly reduced isoflurane MAC in a dose-dependent fashion: by 10% at lower doses, 25% at medium doses and by 60% at higher doses of both the drugs.
T5	Participants 605 761	A 14-gauge catheter was used for endotracheal intubation, and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered in oxygen via a T-piece breathing system.
