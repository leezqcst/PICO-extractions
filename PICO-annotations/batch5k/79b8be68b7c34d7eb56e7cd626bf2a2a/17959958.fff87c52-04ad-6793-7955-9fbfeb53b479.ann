T1	Participants 1048 1273	CONCLUSIONS IV midazolam 0.015 mg/kg administered 90 s before induction of anesthesia with etomidate is effective in reducing myoclonic movements and does not prolong recovery in unpremedicated patients after short procedures
T2	Participants 693 898	RESULTS Two patients (10%) in the midazolam group had myoclonic movements after the administration of etomidate, whereas 10 of the 20 patients (50%) receiving placebo experienced such movements (P = 0.006)
T3	Participants 274 510	METHODS In a double-blind fashion, 40 patients (ASA physical status III-IV) scheduled for elective cardioversion were randomly assigned to receive either 0.015 mg/kg midazolam or placebo 90 s before the injection of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate.
T4	Participants 148 273	BACKGROUND Myoclonic movements are a common problem in unpremedicated patients during induction of anesthesia with etomidate.
