BACKGROUND Myoclonic movements are a common problem in unpremedicated patients during induction of anesthesia with etomidate.
Participants 274 510 6
METHODS In a double-blind fashion, 40 patients (ASA physical status III-IV) scheduled for elective cardioversion were randomly assigned to receive either 0.015 mg/kg midazolam or placebo 90 s before the injection of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate.
Participants 693 898 3
RESULTS Two patients (10%) in the midazolam group had myoclonic movements after the administration of etomidate, whereas 10 of the 20 patients (50%) receiving placebo experienced such movements (P = 0.006)
