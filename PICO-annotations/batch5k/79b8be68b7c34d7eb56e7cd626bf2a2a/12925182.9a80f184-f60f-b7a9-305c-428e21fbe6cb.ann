T1	Participants 392 421	Thirty-seven male Wistar rats
T2	Participants 499 603	For all treatment groups anaesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane in oxygen using an induction chamber
T3	Participants 794 872	minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane (MACISO) was made for each animal
T4	Participants 1660 1740	Both opioids reduced the respiratory rate in a similar way for all doses tested.
T5	Participants 1741 1898	No episodes of apnoea were recorded in the remifentanil groups, while administration of fentanyl resulted in apnoea in three animals (one at each dose level)
T6	Participants 1900 1969	The effects on the cardiovascular system were similar with both drugs
T7	Participants 2004 2049	intraoperative use of remifentanil in the rat
T8	Participants 2221 2396	The use of remifentanil during inhalant anaesthesia in the rat can be considered an intravenous alternative to fentanyl, providing similar reduction in isoflurane requirements
