The Japanese Cooperative Study Group of PBSCT
Participants 259 601 8
a total of 74 children who were scheduled to undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) were prospectively randomized at diagnosis to evaluate the effectiveness of exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment in accelerating hematopoietic recovery after PBSCT
Participants 603 735 3
The diagnosis included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 27), neuroblastoma (n = 29), and miscellaneous solid tumors (n = 18).
Participants 1008 1311 8
11 patients were excluded due to disease progression before PBSCT (n = 6) or a low number of harvested cells (n = 5), leaving 63 patients for analysis; 32 patients in the treatment group (300 microg/m2 of G-CSF intravenously over 1 hour from day 1 of PBSCT) and 31 in the control group without treatment
Participants 1703 1830 4
Five patients (two in the treatment group and three in the control group) were subsequently removed due to protocol violations.
Participants 1831 1859 3
All patients survived PBSCT.
