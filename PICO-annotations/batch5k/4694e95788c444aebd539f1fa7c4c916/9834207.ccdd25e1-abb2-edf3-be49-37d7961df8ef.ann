T1	Participants 33 139	granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy after autologous blood stem cell transplantation in children
T2	Participants 259 451	a total of 74 children who were scheduled to undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) were prospectively randomized at diagnosis
T3	Participants 607 734	diagnosis included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 27), neuroblastoma (n = 29), and miscellaneous solid tumors (n = 18)
T4	Participants 736 971	Eligibility criteria included (1) primary PBSCT, (2) chemotherapy-responsive disease, and (3) collected cell number >1 x 10(5) colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM)/kg and >1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg patient's body weight
T5	Participants 1008 1311	11 patients were excluded due to disease progression before PBSCT (n = 6) or a low number of harvested cells (n = 5), leaving 63 patients for analysis; 32 patients in the treatment group (300 microg/m2 of G-CSF intravenously over 1 hour from day 1 of PBSCT) and 31 in the control group without treatment
