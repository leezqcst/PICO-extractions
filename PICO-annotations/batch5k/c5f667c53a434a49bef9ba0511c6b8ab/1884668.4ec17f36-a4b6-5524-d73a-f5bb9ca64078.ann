T1	Participants 10 54	opioid physical dependence in heroin addicts
T2	Participants 112 136	long-term heroin addicts
T3	Participants 408 746	Patients who received placebo (n = 18) showed a significant increase in the mean score on one of three rating scales used to assess opioid withdrawal. Patients who received naloxone (n = 58) showed significant increases in mean scores on all three rating scales, but this was due primarily to increases observed in a minority of patients.
T4	Participants 747 994	Sixty-one percent of patients failed to manifest clinically significant changes in subjective symptoms, and 74% of patients failed to manifest clinically significant changes in objective signs of opioid withdrawal following naloxone administration
