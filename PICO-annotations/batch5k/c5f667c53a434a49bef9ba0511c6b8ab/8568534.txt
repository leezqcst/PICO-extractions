Correlation of quantitative measures with the modified Ashworth scale in the assessment of plantar flexor spasticity in patients with traumatic brain injury.

This study of plantar flexor spasticity describes relationships among a traditional qualitative spasticity scale, three potential quantitative spasticity measures and a measure of voluntary ankle muscle function. Thirty-four volunteer adult patients with traumatic brain injuries participated. There were 28 males and 6 females; the mean age was 30.3 years. A battery of five randomly sequenced tests was performed for each subject on one ankle. Tests were: modified Ashworth scale (MAS) scoring; H-reflex testing with and without Achilles tendon vibration; H-reflex testing with and without dorsiflexor contraction; reflex threshold angle and timed toe tapping (TTT). Twenty-six subjects returned to have the second ankle tested, resulting in 60 ankles for the analyses. Spearman's coefficients for correlation of quantitative spasticity measures with MAS scores ranged from 0.39 to 0.49 with associated probabilities < or = 0.002. Pearson coefficients for correlation of quantitative spasticity measures with TTT scores were lower but also significant (P < or = 0.07). Multiple correlation for the set of quantitative measures yielded R = 0.614 (P < 0.001) with MAS scores and R = 0.365 (P = 0.045) with TTT scores. These findings reveal statistically significant relationships of low to moderate strength among potential quantitative spasticity measures, a traditional qualitative spasticity scale and a simple measure of voluntary ankle muscle function. Understanding these relationships is an essential part of the ongoing search for quantitative spasticity measures.
