Patients who received placebo (n = 18) showed a significant increase in the mean score on one of three rating scales used to assess opioid withdrawal. Patients who received naloxone (n = 58) showed significant increases in mean scores on all three rating scales, but this was due primarily to increases observed in a minority of patients.
