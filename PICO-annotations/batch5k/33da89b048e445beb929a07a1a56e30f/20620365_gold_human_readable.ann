The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the translucency of zirconia copings for single crowns fabricated using different CAD/CAM systems, using lithium disilicate glass ceramic as a control.

Using impressions made from a stainless steel complete-crown master die, 9 stone cast replicas were fabricated, numbered, and distributed into 8 ceramic ZrO(2) CAD/CAM system groups (Lava Frame 0.3 and 0.5, IPS e.max ZirCAD, VITA YZ, Procera AllZircon, Digizon, DC Zircon, and Cercon Base) and to a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic control group (IPS e.max Press) using a simple computer-generated randomization method
