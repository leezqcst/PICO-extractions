The effect of cyclosporin administered during a third-party blood transfusion protocol on humoral immune responses.

Antigen pre-treatment in animals undoubtedly prolongs graft survival. In man, however, routine pre-transplantation blood transfusions have recently become controversial, principally because of the adverse effect of transfusion-induced sensitisation on graft survival rates. We have monitored the effect of cyclosporin administered during a planned programme of third-party blood transfusions on the development of both cytotoxic and anti-idiotypic antibodies. A total of 24 patients were recruited to the study; ten received cyclosporin with blood transfusions (BT) (group 1), 14 received BT alone (group 2). Anti-HLA antibodies developed in 3 of 9 patients in group 1 and 8 of 12 patients in group 2 (P less than 0.05). Anti-idiotypic antibody activity was detectable in 9 of 9 patients in group 1 and 7 of 12 patients in group 2 (P less than 0.006). The mechanism by which cyclosporin can prevent an anti-HLA antibody response and promote an anti-idiotypic response is unclear.
