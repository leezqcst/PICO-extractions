This two-arm randomized open-label study included 35 HH women (aged 25-36 yr) attending our Center. Eighteen patients received 150 IU hMG-HP (150 IU FSH + 150 IU LH-like activity) and seventeen received 150IU r-hFSH/75IU rhLH daily for a maximum of 16 days. Ovulation was induced by a single administration of hCG on the day after the last hMG-HP or r-hFSH/r-hLH.
