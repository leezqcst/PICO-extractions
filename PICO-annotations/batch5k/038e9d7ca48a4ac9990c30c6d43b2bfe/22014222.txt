Midlife women online: evaluation of an internet-based program to prevent unintended pregnancy & STIs.

BACKGROUND Midlife women are an underserved population in the areas of unintended pregnancy and STI prevention yet remain at risk for both health conditions.
METHODS A randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based multimedia program to reduce risk of unintended pregnancy and STIs among midlife women was conducted with 164 women ages 40-55 years of age.
RESULTS Women in the treatment condition compared to the control condition reported significant gains in attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions at posttest.
CONCLUSION Interventions specifically targeted to midlife women can impact constructs known to reduce risk. Implications for future research and intervention development are presented.
