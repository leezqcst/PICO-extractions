Effects of antihypertensive drugs on cognitive function in adolescents.

The effects of clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide on cognitive function were studied in hypertensive adolescents requiring pharmacologic therapy for blood pressure control. Twenty-four adolescents with persistent blood pressure elevation (greater than 95th%) on placebo were randomized double blind to clonidine or hydrochlorothiazide treatment. A battery of cognitive tests were performed during the placebo phase and after 16 weeks of active therapy. Antihypertensive therapy resulted in significant blood pressure reduction (p less than .01). A slight interactive effect was observed in arithmetic performance (p less than .05). All other parameters of cognitive function were not affected by either treatment.
