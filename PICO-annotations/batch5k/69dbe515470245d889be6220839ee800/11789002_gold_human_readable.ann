Participants 29 94 5
patients with arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities
Participants 101 428 7
patients with advanced atherosclerosis manifested by arterial occlusion in the lower extremities without a baseline blood lipid disorder statin treatment caused improvement of the efficiency, i.e. prolongation of the claudication interval, while in a comparable control group without statins the efficiency deteriorated further
Participants 433 553 5
patients with arterial occlusion of the lower extremities with baseline dyslipidaemia statin treatment proved protective
