A prospective, randomized, double dummy, placebo-controlled trial of oral cefditoren pivoxil 400mg once daily as switch therapy after intravenous ceftriaxone in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis.

OBJECTIVES To compare the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone followed by oral cefditoren pivoxil or IV ceftriaxone for acute pyelonephritis.
METHODS A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was performed. Daily 2g IV ceftriaxone was initially given to all patients. After day 3, patients who satisfied the criteria for switch therapy were randomized to either group A (IV ceftriaxone) or group B (oral cefditoren pivoxil 400mg once daily).
RESULTS Eighty-two patients were enrolled; 41 (50%) patients in group A and 41 (50%) patients in group B were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Clinical cure was observed in 39 of 41 (95.1%) patients in group A and 41 of 41 (100%) patients in group B (p=0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to 0.02). Urine bacteriological eradication was found in 63.4% in group A and 60% in group B (p=0.75, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.25). There was no statistically significant difference in adverse effects between the two treatment groups.
CONCLUSION These data suggest that IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cefditoren pivoxil is highly effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis, even for uropathogens with a high proportion of quinolone-resistant strains.
