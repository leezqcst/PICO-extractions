Osteocalcin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
Participants 89 266 6
To analyze clinical, radiological, and drug (disease modifying antirheumatic drug, DMARD) dependent factors influencing bone turnover in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Participants 597 653 7
Patients (n = 48) enrolled at the beginning of our study
Participants 1426 1618 3
Our data suggest that osteocalcin, a useful followup variable of bone turnover, is changed significantly (p < 0.02) in patients with RA regarding inflammatory activity and functional capacity.
Participants 1656 1799 3
a fall in inflammatory activity stimulated and impairment of functional capacity significantly decreased osteocalcin levels in patients with RA
