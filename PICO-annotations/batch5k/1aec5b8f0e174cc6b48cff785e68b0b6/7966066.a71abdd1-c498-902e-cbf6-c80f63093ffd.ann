T1	Participants 0 49	Osteocalcin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
T2	Participants 51 76	A one-year followup study
T3	Participants 89 266	To analyze clinical, radiological, and drug (disease modifying antirheumatic drug, DMARD) dependent factors influencing bone turnover in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
T4	Participants 377 395	methotrexate (MTX)
T5	Participants 597 653	Patients (n = 48) enrolled at the beginning of our study
T6	Participants 897 960	We found a significant negative correlation of the one-year CRP
T7	Participants 1290 1330	significantly reduced osteocalcin levels
T8	Participants 1426 1618	Our data suggest that osteocalcin, a useful followup variable of bone turnover, is changed significantly (p < 0.02) in patients with RA regarding inflammatory activity and functional capacity.
T9	Participants 1656 1799	a fall in inflammatory activity stimulated and impairment of functional capacity significantly decreased osteocalcin levels in patients with RA
