[EMLA cream (lidocaine/prilocaine) versus infiltration analgesia with carbocaine (mepivacaine) in vasectomy].

The analgesic efficacy of EMLA cream was compared with infiltration with 1% carbocaine in 13 bilateral vasectomies. Twelve patients preferred infiltration analgesia. EMLA analgesia was only effective in the skin, and had to be supplemented as the incision reached subcutaneous tissue.
