T1	Participants 0 59	Leukocyte-depleted reperfusion of transplanted human hearts
T2	Participants 61 103	a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
T3	Participants 125 174	myocardial preservation for heart transplantation
T4	Participants 232 246	beyond 3 hours
T5	Participants 613 653	20 patients were enrolled in a randomize
T6	Participants 684 738	to be treated with either warm whole blood reperfusion
T7	Participants 898 908	10 minutes
T8	Participants 956 990	the first 3 minutes of reperfusion
T9	Participants 1001 1071	donor and recipient age and the ischemic time (142 versus 153 minutes)
T10	Participants 1423 1470	All hearts functioned adequately in both groups
T11	Participants 1764 1834	Mean ejection fraction 1 month after operation was 65% in both groups.
T12	Participants 1835 1870	One early death occurred at 66 days
T13	Participants 2048 2132	leukocyte-depleted reperfusion decreases biochemical evidence of reperfusion injury.
T14	Participants 2222 2314	less than 3 hours, leukocyte-depleted reperfusion may prevent significant reperfusion injury
T15	Participants 2392 2491	Safe extension of the ischemic time would expand the donor pool and allow for better crossmatching.
