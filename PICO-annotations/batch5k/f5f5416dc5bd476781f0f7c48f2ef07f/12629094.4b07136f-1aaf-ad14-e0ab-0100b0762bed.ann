T1	Participants 59 123	growth hormone treatment in three dosages and low dose estrogens
T2	Participants 0 42	Final height in girls with turner syndrome
T3	Participants 353 427	60 girls with Turner syndrome treated in a randomized dose-response trial,
T4	Participants 456 501	low dose estrogens at a relatively young age.
T5	Participants 742 773	minimum of 4 yr of GH treatment
T6	Participants 1502 1581	Fifty of the 60 girls (83%) had reached a normal FH (FH SD score, more than -2)
T7	Participants 1634 1776	height velocity (HV) changed significantly to a stable HV, without affecting bone maturation (change in bone age/change in chronological age).
T8	Participants 1983 2014	GH treatment was well tolerated
T9	Participants 2031 2143	GH treatment leads to a normalization of FH in most girls, even when puberty is induced at a normal pubertal age
T10	Participants 2157 2237	GH dosage depends on height and age at the start of treatment and first year HV.
