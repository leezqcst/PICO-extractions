Timing of antibiotic administration in knee replacement under tourniquet.

Cephamandole levels in serum and drain fluid were measured in 32 knee replacement operations to determine the benefit of an intravenous dose of antibiotic at the time of tourniquet deflation. Concentrations of cephamandole in drain fluid were directly proportional to the serum concentration at the time of tourniquet release. A 'tourniquet-release' dose of antibiotic increased drain fluid concentration threefold.
