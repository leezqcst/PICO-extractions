Participants 166 310 3

Participants 312 495 5
Groups from the sample of the cross-national collaborative panic study (CNCPS) were compared for differences in basic characteristics and for the ability to predict treatment response
Participants 497 669 6
Patients who developed avoidance behavior before the full syndrome of panic disorder had less often a full agoraphobia but were not different in their response to treatment
Participants 671 717 4
Patients with an early onset of panic disorder
