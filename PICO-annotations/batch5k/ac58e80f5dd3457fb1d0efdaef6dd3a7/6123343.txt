An assessment of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in man by prizidilol hydrochloride.

1 Prizidilol hydrochloride (SK&F 92657) is a new compound which causes both arteriolar dilatation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The effect of a single oral dose on the responses of heart rate and blood pressure to isoprenaline infusion has been studied in healthy volunteers. 2 Isoprenaline heart rate dose-response curves showed parallel shifts to the right after oral prizidilol, indicating antagonism by this compound at beta-adrenoceptors in the heart. 3 Isoprenaline dose-response curves for decreases in diastolic blood pressure also showed shifts to the right after oral prizidilol, providing evidence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism by this drug in peripheral resistance vessels. 4 The peak effect of a 40 mg dose of propranolol was greater than that of a 200 mg dose of prizidilol but both drugs caused persistent beta-adrenoceptor blockade for at least 7 h after ingestion.
