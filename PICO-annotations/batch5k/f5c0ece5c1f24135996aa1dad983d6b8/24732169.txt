Effect of a mixed kinesio taping-compression technique on quality of life and clinical and gait parameters in postmenopausal women with chronic venous insufficiency: double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the short-term effect of a mixed Kinesio taping (KT) model on range of ankle motion (ROAM), gait, pain, perimeter of lower limbs, and quality of life in postmenopausal women with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).
DESIGN Double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
SETTING Clinical setting.
PARTICIPANTS Consecutive postmenopausal women (N=130; mean age ± SD, 65.44±14.7y) with mild CVI. No participant withdrew because of adverse effects.
INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to either (1) an experimental group to receive a mixed KT-compression treatment following KT recommendations for gastrocnemius muscle enhancement and functional correction of the ankle, and adding 2 tapes to simulate traditional compression bandages (no KT guidelines); or (2) a placebo control group for sham KT. Both interventions were performed 3 times a week during a 4-week period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES ROAM, gait, pain, perimeter of right and left lower limb, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and 48 hours posttreatment.
RESULTS Quality of life was better in the intervention group by a mean of 8.76 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.96-12.55). The experimental group also showed significant pre-/posttreatment improvements in both lower limbs in gait dorsiflexion ROAM (95% CI, 1.02-2.49), cadence (95% CI, 3.45-1.47), stride length (95% CI, 21.48-10.83), step length (95% CI, 1.68-6.61), stance phase (95% CI, 61-107), and foot (95% CI, .56-.92) and malleolus (95% CI, 1.15-1.63) circumference. None of these variables were significantly modified in the placebo group. Both groups reported a significant reduction in pain.
CONCLUSIONS Ankle dorsiflexion during gait, walking parameters, peripheral edema, venous pain, and quality of life remain improved in patients with CVI at 1 month after mixed KT-compression therapy. KT may have a placebo effect on pain perception.
