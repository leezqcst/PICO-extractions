effects in acute myocardial infarction (MI) on systolic function of the left ventricle, arrhythmia and clinical symptoms in patients on thrombolytic therapy (TLT).
Participants 277 647 8
106 males with Q-MI entered the study. 47 received treatment without TLT and neoton, 30 patients received TLT with streptokinase preparations, 29 patients were given streptokinase preparations and neoton. Left ventricular systolic function was measured by echocardiography on day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28; arrhythmia was analysed at Holter monitoring in day 1 and 2 of MI.
