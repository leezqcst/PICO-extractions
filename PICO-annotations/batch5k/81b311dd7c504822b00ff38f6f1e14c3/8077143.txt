Milk production in cows with endotoxin-induced mastitis treated with isotonic or hypertonic sodium chloride solution.

Milk production was monitored in 16 cows for 6 milkings after intramammary infusion of 1 mg of endotoxin in a single forequarter. The cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups; 8 cows were treated with isotonic saline solution and 8 cows were treated with hypertonic saline solution. Saline solutions were administered IV (5 ml/kg of body weight) 4 hours after infusion of endotoxin. Mean cumulative change in milk yield and interval change in milk yield were greater in cows treated with isotonic saline solution than in cows treated with hypertonic saline solution. Significant differences between treatment groups were not detected.
