Gastric ulcer treatment with intravenous human epidermal growth factor: a double-blind controlled clinical study.

We introduced a double-blind controlled clinical study to compare intravenous human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) to cetraxate hydrochloride (CH), an antiulcer drug, for their healing effect on gastric ulcers. We also prospected an oral use of EGF on the basis of our experimental evidence. In the clinical trial, the rate of ulcer healing within 8 weeks was 77.9% (67/86) in patients receiving 6 micrograms EGF intravenously twice a week, being significantly greater than 51.7% (45/87) in those given CH. Taking together all aspects assessed including the healing rate, pain relief, blood examination and adverse reactions, we judged the hEGF to be a useful and safe anticuler drug. In rats, 50 micrograms/kg mouse EGF (mEGF) and 2% hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) or 1.0 g/kg sucralfate given by gastric intubation significantly raised the residual mEGF levels in both gastric luminal content (HPC: x 30; sucralfate: x 300 as high as those in EGF alone) and tissue (HPC: x 60; sucralfate: x 100). In addition, the combined treatments significantly promoted healing of rat gastric ulcers whereas each agent alone had no significant effect as compared with control (saline). This indicated the beneficial effect on ulcers of oral administration of EGF with agents allowing it to remain at high levels in the stomach, whereas most reports suggested less effect of oral EGF on healing of gastroduodenal ulcers. Subsequent to the clinical study, evaluation of oral use of EGF may be expected as the next step in the treatment of ulcers. The experimental evidence above would possibly be a guide for such trial.
