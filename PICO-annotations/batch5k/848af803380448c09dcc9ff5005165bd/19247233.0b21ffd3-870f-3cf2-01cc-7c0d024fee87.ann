T1	Participants 1440 1640	CONCLUSION Uniform and identical standardised wounds created using an abrasive brush technique can be used to reliably detect differences in the performance of plasters intended for superficial wounds
T2	Participants 765 897	RESULTS Evaluation of wound healing on days 2, 5, 8 and 14 +/- 1 showed best results for the polyurethane and hydrocolloid plasters.
T3	Participants 277 392	METHOD Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled into an open-label, randomised, intra-individual comparison pilot study
T4	Participants 101 275	OBJECTIVE To establish a new wound model that can induce uniform abrasions and use it to assess the healing properties of a range of products commonly applied to these wounds
