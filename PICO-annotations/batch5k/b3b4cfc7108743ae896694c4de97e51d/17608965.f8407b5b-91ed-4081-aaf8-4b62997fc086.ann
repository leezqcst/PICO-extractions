T1	Participants 415 583	One hundred ASA I-II patients, aged 18-60 yr undergoing elective minor surgery, were randomized to receive either an LTS (n = 50) or PLMA (n = 50) for airway management
T2	Participants 848 916	There were no differences in patient characteristics for both groups
T3	Participants 918 1055	First-time and second-time success rates were comparable for both groups (86 vs. 88% and 96 vs. 98% in LTS and PLMA groups, respectively)
T4	Participants 1057 1157	The airway of one patient in each group could not be managed with these devices after three attempts
T5	Participants 1457 1535	Patients were questioned on a variety of postoperative pharyngeal morbidities.
T6	Participants 1536 1587	Only hoarseness was more frequent in the LTS group.
T7	Participants 1694 1743	Better airway seal was detected in the PLMA group
