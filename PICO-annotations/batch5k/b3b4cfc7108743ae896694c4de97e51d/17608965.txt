A comparison of the laryngeal tube-S and Proseal laryngeal mask during outpatient surgical procedures.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The Laryngeal Tube Sonda (LTS) and the ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA) are two new devices introduced for maintaining the airway during controlled ventilation under general anaesthesia. The present investigation compared their performance in a randomized controlled study.
METHODS One hundred ASA I-II patients, aged 18-60 yr undergoing elective minor surgery, were randomized to receive either an LTS (n = 50) or PLMA (n = 50) for airway management. After induction of general anaesthesia, the devices were inserted, its correct placement was verified and airway leak pressure was measured. Ease of insertion, quality of airway seal, fibre-optic view and postoperative pharyngeal morbidity were examined.
RESULTS There were no differences in patient characteristics for both groups. First-time and second-time success rates were comparable for both groups (86 vs. 88% and 96 vs. 98% in LTS and PLMA groups, respectively). The airway of one patient in each group could not be managed with these devices after three attempts. Time until delivery of first tidal volume for LTS and PLMA was 24.5 +/- 6.9 and 28.8 +/- 10.3 s. Fixation and manipulation time was 54.9 +/- 15.2 and 73.2 +/- 25 s, respectively (P < 0.05). Airway seal pressure (cm H(2)O) for LTS and PLMA was 20 +/- 8.6 and 24.1 +/- 10.8, respectively (P = 0.04). Patients were questioned on a variety of postoperative pharyngeal morbidities. Only hoarseness was more frequent in the LTS group.
CONCLUSIONS Both devices provide a secure airway, are similar in clinical utility and are easy to insert. Better airway seal was detected in the PLMA group.
