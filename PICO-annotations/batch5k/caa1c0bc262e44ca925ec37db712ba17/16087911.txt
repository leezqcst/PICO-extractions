A single dose of gabapentin reduces acute pain and allodynia in patients with herpes zoster.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study measured the effect of a single dose of oral gabapentin (900 mg) on pain and allodynia associated with herpes zoster. Pain severity decreased by 66% with gabapentin compared to 33% with placebo. Reductions in allodynia area and severity, and overall pain relief, were also greater with gabapentin.
