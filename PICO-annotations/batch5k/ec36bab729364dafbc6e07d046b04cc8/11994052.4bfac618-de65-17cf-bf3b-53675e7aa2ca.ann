AIMS To determine whether metformin pretreatment has beneficial effects in clomiphene resistant infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in an infertility clinic. METHODS This was a randomized placebo controlled double-blind crossover study of 3 months metformin (1500 mg day-1)/placebo, followed by 3 months metformin/placebo together with clomiphene (50-100 mg for 5 days) for three cycles in clomiphene resistant women with PCOS. The primary outcomes were restoration of spontaneous menses, ovulation induction (spontaneous or clomiphene induced) and pregnancy. Secondary endpoints were changes in biochemical parameters related to androgens and insulin. RESULTS Twelve women completed the metformin arm and 14 the placebo arm
