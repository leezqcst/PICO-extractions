Comparison of postoperative short-term complications after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) versus Lichtenstein tension free inguinal hernia repair: a randomized trial study.

AIM The aim of this randomized trial was to compare short-term postoperative complications of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and Lichtenstein tension free hernia repair.
METHODS A total of 120 patients who went inguinal hernia repair at Shahid Sadoughi university training hospital from April 2011 to August 2013 were randomized into two TAPP (N.=60) and Lichtenstein (N.=60) repair group. Follow-up occurred within 6 weeks. The postoperative assessments included pain score (VAS), hematoma/seroma, urinary retention, wound infection incidence, and duration of hospital stay.
RESULTS Pain was the most common symptoms in both groups. The TAPP group patients significantly had experienced less postoperative pain than the Lichtenstein group in all moments (P<0.05). TAPP group had lower incidence of hematoma (TAPP, 6.6% vs. Lichtenstein 13.3%; P=0.67), seroma (TAPP 10% vs. Lichtenstein 13.3%; P=1.00), and infection (TAPP 0 vs. Lichtenstein 1.6%; P=0.67). However, no differences between the 2 groups were found in terms of postoperative complications. In TAPP group mean of hospital stay significantly was less than Lichtenstein group (TAPP, 8.13±2.19 vs. Lichtenstein, 13.15±1.5 days; P<0.001).
CONCLUSION The laparoscopic TAPP repair is safer and less complicated approach to inguinal hernia repair. The two main short-term advantages of the laparoscopic TAPP repair with the tension free Lichtenstein repair were less postoperative pain and earlier return to the normal life activities. No difference was seen in overall complications.
