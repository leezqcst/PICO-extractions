T1	Participants 0 86	Anti-angiogenic effect of tamoxifen combined with epirubicin in breast cancer patients
T2	Participants 370 532	We investigated to compare the effects of the addition of tamoxifen to epirubicin versus epirubicin alone on VEGF and VEGFR2 expression in breast cancer patients.
T3	Participants 533 868	The expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 was assessed on tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry at baseline conditions and after treatments in the case of 191 patients with T2-4 N0-1 breast cancer enrolled in a randomized trial comparing four cycles of single agent epirubicin versus epirubicin plus tamoxifen as primary systemic treatment
T4	Participants 1075 1245	baseline VEGF had a negative prognostic role in patients who received epirubicin alone but not in patients receiving epirubicin plus tamoxifen (interaction test P < 0.05)
T5	Participants 1247 1396	VEGFR2 expression increased at residual tumor histology in both treatment arms, with a lesser extent in patients receiving tamoxifen plus epirubicin.
