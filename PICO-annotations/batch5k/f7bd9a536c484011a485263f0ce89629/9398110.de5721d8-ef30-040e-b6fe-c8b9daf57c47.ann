T1	Participants 0 165	The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril on plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
T2	Participants 740 803	(20 patients in the imidapril group and 20 in the placebo group
T3	Participants 806 1096	The levels of serum ACE activity in the imidapril group decreased significantly (p < 0.01) 8 hours after the administration of imidapril, and the levels 24 hours after administration were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (3.6 +/- 0.6 IU/L vs 7.4 +/- 0.8 IU/L; p < 0.001).
T4	Participants 1216 1309	The levels in the placebo group decreased gradually but remained high during the study period
T5	Participants 1311 1546	On the other hand, the levels of PAI activity in the imidapril group decreased rapidly and those 48 hours after administration were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (7.9 +/- 1.9 IU/ml vs 18.4 +/- 3.5 IU/ml; p < 0.01)
T6	Participants 1552 1745	levels of left ventricular ejection fraction about 2 weeks after admission were significantly higher in the imidapril group than in the placebo group (65.9% +/- 2.5% vs 49.1% +/- 4.4%; p < 0.01
