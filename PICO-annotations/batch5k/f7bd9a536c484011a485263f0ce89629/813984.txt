[A controlled study of treating haemophilia A on an out-patient basis (author's transl)].

For six months 36 U factor VIII concentrates per kg bodyweight and week were administered to six out-patients with severe haemophilia A. The injection regimen was changed in every patient every two months, from 36 U/kg once to 18 U/kg twice and 12 U/kg three times, intravenously. The six possible combinations of these three dosage schedules were used in the patients in a strictly randomised manner, and all patients were treated during the same period. In the pre-trial period (treatment as needed) there were an average of 35 bleedings per two months. On continual treatment there were 21 bleedings on weekly injections of 36 U factor VIII per kg, 14 on twice weekly 18 U/kg and none on 12 U/kg, three times weekly. The differences are statistically significant. The absence of bleeding on the last dosage schedule was achieved during normal working. Days lost from work per patient per month was zero on three times 12 U/kg, 0.4 day on twice 18 U/kg and once 36 U/kg, while it had been five days in the pre-trial period. In addition to freedom from bleeding and no lost days from work, there was increased mobility and physical capacity.
