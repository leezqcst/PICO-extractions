Selected polymorphisms of GSTP1 and TERT were associated with glioma risk in Han Chinese.

BACKGROUND Current evidence suggests that a majority of the inherited risks play a major role in glioma susceptibility, and glioma is due to the co-inheritance of multiple low-risk variants. These variants can be identified through association studies including such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has led the glioma epidemiology researchers to focus on identifying potential disease-causing factors.
METHODS We evaluated and validated 10 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in seven genes associated with glioma susceptibility in a Han Chinese population, including 301 glioma cases and 302 controls, using a multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MassEXTEND assay. We ascertained the genotypic frequencies for each tSNP in control subjects were within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using an exact test, and then compared the genotype and allele frequencies of glioma patients and control subjects using the Ï‡2 test. We then applied three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive) using PLINK software to assess the association of each tSNP with glioma risk.
RESULTS We identified two tSNPs to be associated with glioma susceptibility (rs1695, GSTP1, P = 0.019; rs2853676, TERT, P = 0.039), which we confirmed using dominant and additive model analyses. The genotype &ldquo;GA&rdquo; for rs1695 was recognized to be a protective genotype for glioma (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.96; P = 0.027), while the genotype &ldquo;AG&rdquo; for rs2853676 was shown to be a risk genotype for glioma (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.05-2.15; P = 0.025).
CONCLUSION Our results, and those from previous studies, suggest potential genetic contributes for GSTP1 and TERT in glioma development.
