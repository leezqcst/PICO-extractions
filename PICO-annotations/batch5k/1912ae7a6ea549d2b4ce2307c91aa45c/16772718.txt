Intermittent recombinant growth hormone treatment in short children born small for gestational age: four-year results of a randomized trial of two different treatment regimens.

BACKGROUND Treatment of short children born small for gestational age SGA with recombinant human growth hormone r-hGH increases growth velocity during childhood. As in other indications, the growth velocity in these patients is more marked during the first year of treatment and then decreases. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different r-hGH treatment schedules (67 microg/kg/day in a discontinuous or continuous regimen) during the second year of r-hGH treatment by comparing height velocity changes and total gain of height over a 4-year period.
METHODS 58 growth-retarded SGA children aged 2-5 years were randomized to a TOTO regimen (4 years alternating treatment (T) and observation (O), n = 30) or a TTOO regimen (2 years' treatment, followed by 2 years' observation, n = 28). Height velocity HV and total height gain were assessed during the 4-year study.
RESULTS In both groups, HV and HV standard deviation score HV-SDSCA increased during treatment and decreased during observation periods. Interruption of treatment in the TOTO group did not result in a better gain in height standard deviation score H-SDSCA when compared with the TTOO group. After 4 years of study, the gain in H-SDSCA was 1.4 + or - 01 in the TOTO group and 1.6 + or - 0.2 in the TTOO group leading to a mean height of -2.0 + or - 1.0 SDS and -2.0 + or - 0.8 SDS, respectively. The rate of bone maturation was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS In short SGA children, TOTO and TTOO regimens produced significant improvements in growth during r-hGH treatment. However, treatment interruption after 1 year did not influence the overall gain in height SDS when compared with 2 years' continuous treatment.
