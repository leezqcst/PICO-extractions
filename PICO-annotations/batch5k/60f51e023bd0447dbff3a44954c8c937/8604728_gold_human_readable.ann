PURPOSE To determine the efficacy and safety of subconjunctival 5- fluorouracil injections after trabeculectomy in patients with poor prognoses, to determine risk factors for surgical failure and to examine the relationship of intraocular pressure and visual function.

METHODS In this multicenter clinical trial, 213 patients with previous cataract surgery or previous failed filtering surgery were randomly assigned to receive either trabeculectomy alone or trabeculectomy with postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections.
Participants 971 1178 3
RESULTS Fifty-four (51%) of the 105 eyes in the 5-fluorouracil group and 80 (74%) of the 108 eyes in the standard filtering surgery group were classified as failures (P < .001, Mantel-Cox survival analysis).
