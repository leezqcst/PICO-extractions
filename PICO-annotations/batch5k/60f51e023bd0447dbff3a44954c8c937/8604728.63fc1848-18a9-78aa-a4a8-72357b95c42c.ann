T1	Participants 1712 1943	CONCLUSIONS We recommend the use of subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil after trabeculectomy in eyes after previous cataract surgery or unsuccessful filtering surgery, but caution against its routine use in patients with good prognoses.
T2	Participants 971 1178	RESULTS Fifty-four (51%) of the 105 eyes in the 5-fluorouracil group and 80 (74%) of the 108 eyes in the standard filtering surgery group were classified as failures (P < .001, Mantel-Cox survival analysis).
T3	Participants 383 649	METHODS In this multicenter clinical trial, 213 patients with previous cataract surgery or previous failed filtering surgery were randomly assigned to receive either trabeculectomy alone or trabeculectomy with postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections.
T4	Participants 114 382	PURPOSE To determine the efficacy and safety of subconjunctival 5- fluorouracil injections after trabeculectomy in patients with poor prognoses, to determine risk factors for surgical failure and to examine the relationship of intraocular pressure and visual function.
T5	Participants 0 64	Five-year follow-up of the Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study.
