T1	Participants 0 67	Diazoxide and labetalol in acute hypertension during haemodialysis.
T2	Participants 69 300	The antihypertensive effect of the peripheral vasodilator diazoxide in 13 patients and the alpha-beta adrenoceptor blocking agent labetalol in 12 patients were compared in 46 severe acute hypertensive episodes during haemodialysis.
T3	Participants 1433 1626	At the end of haemodialysis the percentage reduction in mean arterial blood pressure was 23 +/- 2% in the diazoxide-treated group and 17 +/- 2% after labetalol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
