T1	Participants 451 570	Risk of ACL failure is significantly greater in female knee specimens with a limited range of internal femoral rotation
T2	Participants 757 1020	A custom-built testing apparatus was used to simulate repeated single-leg pivot landings with a 4Ã—-body weight impulsive load that induces knee compression, knee flexion, and internal tibial torque in 32 paired human knee specimens from 8 male and 8 female donors
T3	Participants 1839 1932	The female knee specimens had a risk of ACL failure 26.9 times higher than the male specimens
