T1	Participants 307 403	determine the incidence of gingival overgrowth in a group of children post liver transplantation
T2	Participants 411 499	compare gingival overgrowth in children receiving FK506 with those receiving cyclosporin
T3	Participants 509 669	Seventy-nine children (aged 15-196 months) undergoing liver transplantation at Birmingham Children's Hospital between October 1998 and October 2000 were studied
T4	Participants 770 862	Gingival overgrowth scores of the patients on each immunosuppressant drug were then compared
T5	Participants 872 951	Fifty-two patients were treated with cyclosporin and 27 treated with tacrolimus
T6	Participants 953 1001	Eighteen children were also receiving nifedipine
T7	Participants 1076 1215	Of the 41 children receiving cyclosporin alone, 26 exhibited gingival overgrowth compared to zero of 20 patients receiving tacrolimus alone
T8	Participants 1218 1308	hose children treated with immunosuppression plus nifedipine developed gingival overgrowth
T9	Participants 1319 1368	this was much less marked in the tacrolimus group
T10	Participants 1416 1531	not associated with gingival overgrowth when used for immunosuppression following liver transplantation in children
T11	Participants 1537 1575	may be the drug of choice for children
