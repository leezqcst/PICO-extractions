Data were collected at admission and at discharge, and then at 3 and 9 months after discharge. The intervention group received family education, and data on their knowledge about schizophrenia, symptoms, functioning, psychosocial behaviour, relapse and medication adherence were collected and compared with the control group.
RESULTS There was a significant improvement in knowledge about schizophrenia in the experimental group and a significant difference in symptom scores and functioning at 9 months after discharge. Patients who were nonadherent to medication regimens were more likely to relapse.
