Efficiency of adjuvant immunochemotherapy following curative resection in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND Despite curative resection, 50%-90% of gastric cancer patients die of disease relapse. Although some clinical trials have indicated that chemotherapy and immunochemotherapy may be effective modalities, more recent studies have not been able to define the standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. The present study evaluated the effect of adjuvant immunochemotherapy with the use of BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and FAM (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, mitomycin C) chemotherapy on the survival of patients with locally advanced resectable gastric cancer.
METHODS A total of 156 patients with stage III or IV gastric cancer who had undergone curative resection were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: BCG + FAM (immunochemotherapy), FAM (chemotherapy), and control (surgery only). Treatment was continued for 2 years or until death. Further postsurgical follow up was carried on for up to 10 years.
RESULTS Overall 10-year survival was 47.1% for the immunochemotherapy group (P < 0.037 vs FAM and P < 0.0006 vs control), 30% for the chemotherapy group (vs control, NS), and 15.2% for the control group. In patients with pT2/T3 primary tumors, 10-year survival was 55.3% for BCG + FAM vs 28.2% for FAM (P < 0.01) and 14.6% for the control group (P < 0.00018). BCG + FAM significantly improved the survival of patients with intestinal-type but not diffuse-type cancer. Immunochemotherapy was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION This study, based on a limited number of patients, indicates that adjuvant immunochemotherapy (BCG + FAM) may prolong the survival of gastric cancer patients after curative gastrectomy; in particular, in patients with pT2/T3 tumors and intestinal-type primary tumors. There was no survival benefit from FAM adjuvant chemotherapy.
