Among the cases treated with pyrantel, the egg negative conversion rates of the three above mentioned parasites were 73.5, 90.0 and 28.8% respectively. The egg reduction rate of hookworm was 98.8%. Among the cases treated with placebo, the egg negative conversion rates of the three above mentioned parasites were 6.5, 29.7 and 7.9%.
