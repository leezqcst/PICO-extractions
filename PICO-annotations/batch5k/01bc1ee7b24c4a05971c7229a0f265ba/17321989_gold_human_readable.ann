in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes: a Japanese multicenter randomized, controlled study
Participants 245 488 7
randomized, controlled study comparing the prophylactic effects of capsule forms of fluconazole (n = 110) and itraconazole (n = 108) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) during and after chemotherapy
Participants 490 647 5
There were 4 cases with possible systemic fungal infection in the itraconazole group, and there were 8 possible and 3 probable cases in the fluconazole group
Participants 710 782 3
In patients with MDS or in the remission-induction phase of chemotherapy
Participants 788 908 3
numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the itraconazole group than in the fluconazole group
Participants 1007 1056 3
patients with neutrophil counts of >0.1 x 10(9)/L
Participants 1242 1476 5
Our results suggest that both drugs were well tolerated in patients with AML or MDS who received chemotherapy and that the efficacy of itraconazole for prophylaxis against systemic fungal disease is not inferior to that of fluconazole
