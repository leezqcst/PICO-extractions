T1	Participants 357 418	I-III patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH).

T5	Participants 873 1053	patients developing severe nausea, retching, or vomiting, defined as severe emetic sequelae (SES), were deemed to have failed antiemetic prophylaxis and received antiemetic rescue.
T6	Participants 1070 1231	larger number of patients who received i.v. ondansetron (63%), droperidol (76%), and perphenazine (70%) were free of SES when compared to placebo (43%); P < 0.05
T7	Participants 1233 1263	Metoclopramide was ineffective
T8	Participants 1441 1509	perphenazine is the best choice for antiemetic prophylaxis after TAH
T9	Participants 1274 1415	ondansetron, droperidol, and perphenazine were effective in providing antiemetic prophylaxis, only i.v. perphenazine was free of side effects
