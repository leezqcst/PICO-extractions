T1	Participants 47 92	patients insufficiently controlled on timolol
T2	Participants 233 289	patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension
T3	Participants 416 569	53 patients with primary open angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma, or ocular hypertension with an IOP of at least 21 mmHg on current therapy were recruited
T4	Participants 646 693	patients were randomised to one of three groups
T5	Participants 695 855	One group continued on timolol, one switched from timolol to latanoprost, 50 microg/ml once daily, and a third group received latanoprost in addition to timolol
T6	Participants 961 1275	IOP at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment (mean +/- SEM) were 24.2 +/- 0.9 and 23.8 +/- 1.0 mmHg (n = 16) for patients continuing on timolol, 26.3 +/- 1.2 and 19.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg (n = 17) for patients switching to latanoprost, and 23.2 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg (n = 17) for patients with combined treatment
T7	Participants 1277 1510	Adding latanoprost to timolol reduced IOP with 5.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (p < 0.001) and switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced IOP with 5.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg (p < 0.001), which caused in each group a significant IOP reduction of about 25%.
T8	Participants 1523 1771	The effect of latanoprost was additive to that of timolol, and a good effect on IOP reduction was also achieved by switching from timolol to latanoprost, suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to combination treatment
