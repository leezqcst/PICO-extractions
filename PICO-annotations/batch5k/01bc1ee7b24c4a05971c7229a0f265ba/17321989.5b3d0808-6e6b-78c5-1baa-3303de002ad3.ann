T1	Participants 108 174	patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes
T2	Participants 381 458	patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
T3	Participants 490 647	There were 4 cases with possible systemic fungal infection in the itraconazole group, and there were 8 possible and 3 probable cases in the fluconazole group
T4	Participants 649 709	Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups.
T5	Participants 713 782	patients with MDS or in the remission-induction phase of chemotherapy
T6	Participants 788 908	numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the itraconazole group than in the fluconazole group
T7	Participants 918 1002	no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of therapy
T8	Participants 1007 1056	patients with neutrophil counts of >0.1 x 10(9)/L
T9	Participants 1140 1240	(5 of 9 patients) was significantly higher than in the itraconazole group (0 of 7 patients; P = .03)
T10	Participants 1242 1476	Our results suggest that both drugs were well tolerated in patients with AML or MDS who received chemotherapy and that the efficacy of itraconazole for prophylaxis against systemic fungal disease is not inferior to that of fluconazole
