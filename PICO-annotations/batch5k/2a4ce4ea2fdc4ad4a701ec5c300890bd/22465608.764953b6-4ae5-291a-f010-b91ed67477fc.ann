T1	Participants 780 905	Prospective study of 104 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography who were randomized to one of these techniques.
T2	Participants 1204 1367	when only the last 50 patients were analyzed, we found no difference in procedure time between the groups, probably related to the learning curve of the operators.
