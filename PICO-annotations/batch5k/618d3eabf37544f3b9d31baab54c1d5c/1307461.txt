[Myocardial ischemia with stable angina pectoris: clinico-ergometric evaluation after the use of diltiazem].

PURPOSE To evaluate the efficacy of diltiazem versus placebo in patients with stable angina.
METHODS Eight-seven angina pectoris patients, mean age of 57 +/- 9, 82 white and 79 male were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial of two groups of patients diltiazem and placebo, 3 to 4 tablets a day (diltiazem 180 to 240 mg daily). The patients were evaluated after laboratory tests and clinical-ergometric examinations. A coronary arteriography was performed on study entry.
RESULTS The average of anginal attacks, number of weekly sublingual nitrate, heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressure at rest and at the end of diltiazem period were significantly lower (p < 0.05) regarding same periods on placebo. The percentage of depression for ST-segment was lower for diltiazem when compared with placebo (p < 0.05) and the percentage of patients that reach higher stages in the ergometric test was significantly better for diltiazem. Heart rate and systolic plus diastolic pressures after exercise did not differ in both groups.
CONCLUSION Diltiazem reduced the clinical and electrocardiographical aspects and raises the effort tolerance during the ergometric test in patients with stable angina.
