Ascorbic acid and performance in man.

Effects on performance of 1, 2 and 4 g ascorbic acid were studied from 0.5-5.5 h after ingestion in six healthy females. Diazepam (5 mg) was included as an active control, and it impaired digit symbol substitution, visuomotor coordination and complex reaction time. There were no effects of any dose of ascorbic acid on performance.
