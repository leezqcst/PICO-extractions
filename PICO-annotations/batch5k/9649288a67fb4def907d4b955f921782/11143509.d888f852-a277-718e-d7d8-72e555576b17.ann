T1	Participants 769 997	CONCLUSION These findings suggest that a Longmire-Interposition with or without a pouch for reconstruction after total gastrectomy is not connected with a higher morbidity or mortality in comparison to a Roux-en-Y-reconstruction
T2	Participants 269 478	METHODOLOGY 49 patients who underwent gastrectomy with Longmire-Interposition with (n = 33) or without (n = 16) an additional pouch and 46 patients with a Roux-en-Y-reconstruction were analysed retrospectively
T3	Participants 526 767	RESULTS There were no significant differences between the reconstruction groups for postoperative complications (Roux-en-Y vs. Longmire-Interposition with and without pouch: 30.4% vs. 28.6% for the morbidity; 4.3% vs. 4.1% for the mortality)
