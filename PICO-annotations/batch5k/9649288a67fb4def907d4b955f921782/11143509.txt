[Complication rate after gastrectomy and pouch reconstruction with Longmire interposition].

BACKGROUND/AIMS To determine whether a Longmire-Interposition with or without a pouch used for reconstruction after gastrectomy influences the postoperative complication rate.
METHODOLOGY 49 patients who underwent gastrectomy with Longmire-Interposition with (n = 33) or without (n = 16) an additional pouch and 46 patients with a Roux-en-Y-reconstruction were analysed retrospectively. Complication rate and mortality were studied.
RESULTS There were no significant differences between the reconstruction groups for postoperative complications (Roux-en-Y vs. Longmire-Interposition with and without pouch: 30.4% vs. 28.6% for the morbidity; 4.3% vs. 4.1% for the mortality).
CONCLUSION These findings suggest that a Longmire-Interposition with or without a pouch for reconstruction after total gastrectomy is not connected with a higher morbidity or mortality in comparison to a Roux-en-Y-reconstruction.
