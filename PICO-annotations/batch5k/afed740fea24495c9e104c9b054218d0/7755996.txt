A prospective comparison of the multiplane probe with the biplane probe in structure visualization and Doppler examination during transesophageal echocardiography.

To compare the imaging capability of the multiplane probe with that of the biplane probe, 317 consecutive patients were randomized to undergo transesophageal echocardiography with either probe. Images of 24 cardiac structures and nine Doppler signals were graded prospectively on a three-grade system. Both multiplane and biplane probes provided excellent visualization of cardiac structures and Doppler signals, but the multiplane probe was significantly superior to the biplane probe. There were no differences in the number of attempts at esophageal intubation, the amount of sedation used, and the examination time. The number of complications was similar, although all failed intubations occurred with the multiplane probe.
