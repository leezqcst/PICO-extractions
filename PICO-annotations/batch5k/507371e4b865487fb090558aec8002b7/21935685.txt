Effect of intravenous dezocine on fentanyl-induced cough during general anesthesia induction: a double-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

PURPOSE To evaluate the suppressive effect of intravenous dezocine on fentanyl-induced cough during the induction of general anesthesia.
METHODS A total of 120 patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II, were randomized into two equally sized groups (n = 60). These two groups were given either intravenous dezocine 0.1 mg/kg or a matching placebo (equal volume of 0.9% saline) 10 min before the induction of general anesthesia. Patients were induced with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg, fentanyl 5 Î¼g/kg, propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg, and suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. The injection time of fentanyl was less than 2 s in all patients. The occurrence of cough was recorded 2 min after fentanyl bolus.
RESULTS No patient in the dezocine group had cough, and 42 patients in the control group had cough. This difference was statistically different between these two groups (P = 0.000).
CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that intravenous dezocine 0.1 mg/kg 10 min prior to induction was effective in suppressing fentanyl-induced cough in our patients.
