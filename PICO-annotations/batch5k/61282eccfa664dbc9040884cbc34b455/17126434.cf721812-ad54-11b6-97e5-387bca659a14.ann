T1	Participants 432 540	Patients receiving BCT and 50Gy whole breast irradiation were randomized to no boost and 16Gy boost (N=5318)
T2	Participants 806 869	However in younger patients the 5-year local failure was higher
T3	Participants 917 1030	If the threshold-age for boost treatment were set at 40 years, 8.4% of the study population would receive a boost
T4	Participants 1101 1190	Changing the threshold-age to 60 years, 67% of the study population would receive a boost
T5	Participants 1258 1349	In younger patients a boost dose resulted in a greater absolute reduction of local failure.
T6	Participants 1350 1410	The relative risk reduction was however similar for all ages
