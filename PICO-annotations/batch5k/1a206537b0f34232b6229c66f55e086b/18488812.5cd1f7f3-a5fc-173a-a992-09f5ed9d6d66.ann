T1	Participants 381 940	The study was conducted using an open, randomized, two-period crossover design with a 1-week washout interval, in two groups, with and without food. Plasma samples were obtained for up to 24 h post dose. Plasma pantoprazole concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) with positive ion electrospray ionization using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM). From the pantoprazole plasma concentration vs. time curves, the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(last) and C(max) were obtained, with and without food.
