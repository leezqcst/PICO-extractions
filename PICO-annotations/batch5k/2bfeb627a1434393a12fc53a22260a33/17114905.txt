A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided laser photocoagulation for treatment of benign thyroid nodules.

This randomized controlled study was designed to test the efficacy and safety of percutaneous ultrasound (US)-guided laser photocoagulation (PLP) for treatment of subjects with compressive symptoms due to benign thyroid nodules and/or at high surgical risk. Twenty six subjects were randomized to the intervention (no. 13, age 68+/-3 yr, mean+/-SEM) or observation (no. 13, age 71+/-2 yr) groups. In the control group, the volume of nodules did not significantly change over the 30 week period of observation. In the intervention group, median nodule volume at baseline was 8.2 ml (range 2.8-26.9) and was not significantly different from that of the control group. Nodules decreased significantly (p<0.0001) by 22% after 2 weeks (6.5 ml; range 2.4-16.7) and by 44% after 30 weeks (4.6 ml; range 0.69-14.2). Energy given was correlated (p<0.05) with the reduction of thyroid nodule volume. All patients tolerated the treatment well and reported relief from compressive and cosmetic complaints (p<0.05). At the time of enrolment 7/13 (54%) and 6/13 (46%) of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively, had sub clinical hyperthyroidism. PLP normalized thyroid function at 6 and 30 weeks after treatment. In conclusion, PLP is a promising safe and effective procedure for treatment of benign thyroid nodules in patients at high surgical risk.
