Sivelestat sodium hydrate improves septic acute lung injury by reducing alveolar dysfunction.

Sivelestat sodium hydrate (sivelestat) is a selective inhibitor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase (PMN-E). We administered sivelestat to patients with septic acute lung injury (ALI) to examine its usefulness. The primary endpoints in the study were the duration of artificial ventilation and pulmonary oxygenation ability, and the secondary endpoints were mortality and the concentrations of PMN-E, SP-D, TNF-alpha and IL-8 in blood. In the sivelestat group, the duration of artificial ventilation, pulmonary oxygenation ability, and the blood PMN-E, SP-D, TNF-alpha and IL-8 concentrations decreased significantly. Administration of sivelestat was found to reduce alveolar dysfunction and improve respiratory function, and it was suggested that early administration might be useful.
