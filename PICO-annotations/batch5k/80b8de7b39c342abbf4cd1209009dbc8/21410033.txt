Hepatobiliary response in postoperative lipid therapy in gastrointestinal surgery.

BACKGROUND/AIMS Intravenous lipid emulsions may contribute to the development of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)--induced hepatobiliary complications.
METHODS In a prospective, randomised setting the authors compared the short-term hepatic effects of medium-chain triglycerides/short-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) physical mixture with a four-component intravenous (i.v.) lipid emulsion (LCT, MCT, Olive-oil and Fish-oil) in patients undergoing elective gastrointestial surgery during the early postoperative period.
RESULTS The authors demonstrated that total and conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino transferase and cholinesterase did not change significantly during the 5-days observation period. In contrast to this, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity increased by 2,4 times during 5-days therapy with the lipid emulsions mentioned above (SMOF lipid: 21,9 to 52,9 U/L, Lipofundin: from 32,5 to 79,6 U/L).
CONCLUSION during a 4-days administration hepatic effect of the intravenous lipid emulsions did not differ significantly. The changes in enzyme levels confirm the cholestatic type of hepatobiliary deviations without clinical impact on short-term TPN therapy.
