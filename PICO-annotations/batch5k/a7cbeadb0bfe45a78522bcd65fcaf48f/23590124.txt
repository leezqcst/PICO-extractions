Is the effect of mobile phone radiofrequency waves on human skin perfusion non-thermal?

OBJECTIVE To establish whether SkBF can be modified by exposure to the radiofrequency waves emitted by a mobile phone when the latter is held against the jaw and ear.
METHODS Variations in SkBF and Tsk in adult volunteers were simultaneously recorded with a thermostatic laser Doppler system during a 20-minute "radiofrequency" exposure session and a 20-minute "sham" session. The skin microvessels' vasodilatory reserve was assessed with a heat challenge at the end of the protocol.
RESULTS During the radiofrequency exposure session, SkBF increased (vs. baseline) more than during the sham exposure session. The sessions did not differ significant in terms of the Tsk time-course response. The skin microvessels' vasodilatory ability was found to be greater during radiofrequency exposure than during sham exposure.
CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal the existence of a specific vasodilatory effect of mobile phone radiofrequency emission on skin perfusion.
