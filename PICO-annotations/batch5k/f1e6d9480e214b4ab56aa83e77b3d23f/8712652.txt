Comparison of diclofenac sodium and morphine sulphate for postoperative analgesia after day case inguinal hernia surgery.

Postoperative pain may be a significant reason for delayed discharge from hospital, increased morbidity and reduced patient satisfaction with ambulatory hernia surgery. This study compared two postoperative oral analgesic protocols after day case inguinal hernia repair; 30 mg morphine sulphate (MST) and 10 mg metoclopramide every 8 h for 48 h or 75 mg diclofenac twice daily for 48 h. The pain reported in the MST group was significantly greater on both the day of operation and the first postoperative day (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). A significantly higher proportion of patients taking MST complained of nausea on the day of operation and on the 1st postoperative day (P < 0.05, chi 2). The time taken to walk, dress and leave home alone were achieved in a significantly shorter duration in patients taking diclofenac. We conclude that diclofenac provides effective analgesia, has a more acceptable side-effect profile than morphine sulphate and is the treatment of choice after ambulatory hernia surgery.
