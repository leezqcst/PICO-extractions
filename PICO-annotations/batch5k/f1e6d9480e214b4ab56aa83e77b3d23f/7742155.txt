The effect of fasting on total serum bilirubin concentrations.

Thirty-seven healthy volunteers, 19 of whom had consistently elevated total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations, took part in an open, randomised cross-over study to determine the effect of fasting on TSB concentrations. The study comprised of two treatments. During one treatment period volunteers ate a standard supper but fasted for 24 h thereafter. During the other treatment period volunteers ate a standard supper, snacks, breakfast and lunch. TSB concentrations were measured at regular intervals. In both the normal and high bilirubin groups, minimum TSB values were recorded 4 h after the supper. A 24 h fast more than doubled TSB concentration from baseline values in both the normal and high bilirubin groups. A clinically relevant rise in TSB took place after 12 h into the fasting period (TSB of 17.3 mumol l-1 in the fasted group vs 14.0 mumol l-1 in the non-fasted group). When designing a clinical trial, selecting volunteers, or judging the tolerance of a new drug, the rise in TSB caused by fasting must therefore be taken into account, particularly in trials where volunteers or patients fast before entering the study.
