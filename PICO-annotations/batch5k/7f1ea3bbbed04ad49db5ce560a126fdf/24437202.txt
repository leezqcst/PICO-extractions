[Rehabilitation of the patients presenting with combined pathology: dyscirculatory encephalopathy and climacteric syndrome].

The present paper reports the data on rehabilitation of women presenting with combined pathology: dyscirculatory encephalopathy and climacteric syndrome. It is shown that the introduction of ozonotherapy and klimadynon, a herbal medicine possessed of the estrogen-like action, into combined rehabilitative treatment ensures the significant improvement of the parameters of interest, such as climacteric symptoms, short-term memory, lipid profile, endothelial function, cerebral circulation, and quality of life.
