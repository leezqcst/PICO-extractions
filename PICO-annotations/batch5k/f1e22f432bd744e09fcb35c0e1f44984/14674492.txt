Clinical and radiographic evaluation of guided tissue regeneration in the treatment of class II furcation defects. A randomized clinical trial.

PURPOSE To evaluate the treatment outcomes after guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with a bioabsorbable membrane in Class II furcation defects in mandibular molars. The open flap debridement (OFD) was used as the control.
METHODS Nine patients, with two comparable Class II furcation defects were included in the study. After initial preparation, the defects were randomly assigned in each patient to either GTR-group or OFD-group. Clinical parameters and standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline and 6 months after the surgeries. The radiographs were analyzed by subtraction radiography.
RESULTS Comparing baseline to 6-month results, both groups showed statistically significant probing depth reduction (PD), horizontal clinical attachment level (CAL-h) gain, and increase in gingival recession (GR). The vertical clinical attachment level (CAL-v) gain was statistically significant only for the OFD-group. Comparing the two treatments, no statistically significant differences were found in PD reduction (GTR: 1.67 mm; OFD: 2.51 mm, P = 0.26), CAL-v gain (GTR: 0.62 mm; OFD: 1.16 mm, P= 0.37), and GR increase (GTR: 1.04 mm; OFD: 1.24 mm, P = 0.31). GTR provided complete closure of the furcation defect in two sites and superior horizontal clinical attachment level gain (GTR: 2.27 mm; OFD: 1.01 mm, P = 0.05). Subtraction radiography showed significant difference in bone height change between GTR-group and OFD-group (-0.14 mm and 0.86 mm, respectively; P = 0.028) at 6 months.
