We compared total BMD changes over 96 weeks in 106 ART-naive HIV-infected subjects who were randomized to receive efavirenz (EFV) + zidovudine/lamivudine (n = 32) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) + zidovudine/lamivudine induction (n = 74) for 24-48 weeks followed by LPV/r monotherapy. We also sought to identify factors associated with BMD loss, including markers of systemic inflammation [soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors (sTNFR I and II)
