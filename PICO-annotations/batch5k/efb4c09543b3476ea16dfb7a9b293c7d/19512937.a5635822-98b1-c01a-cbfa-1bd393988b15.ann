T1	Participants 337 620	We compared total BMD changes over 96 weeks in 106 ART-naive HIV-infected subjects who were randomized to receive efavirenz (EFV) + zidovudine/lamivudine (n = 32) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) + zidovudine/lamivudine induction (n = 74) for 24-48 weeks followed by LPV/r monotherapy.
T2	Participants 180 201	HIV-infected patients
T3	Participants 1375 1516	Subjects with lower baseline CD4 T cell count, non-black race, and higher baseline glucose demonstrated a higher risk for >5% decrease in BMD
T4	Participants 1581 1599	ART-naive subjects
