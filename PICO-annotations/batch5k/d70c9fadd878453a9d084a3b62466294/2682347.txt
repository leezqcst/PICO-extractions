Auditory evoked potential modifications according to clinical and biochemical responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior.

Evoked potentials to auditory stimulations varying in intensity were studied in 13 children with autistic behavior treated with fenfluramine. Modifications of both amplitude and single-trial potential variability were considered according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to this drug. Six children (responders) were clinically improved by the treatment. Electrophysiological data were affected according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to fenfluramine: the auditory evoked potential amplitude increased, and the single-trial potential variability decreased at each intensity level only in responders whose dopaminergic metabolism was significantly modified by fenfluramine treatment. No modification was found in nonresponders. Both biochemical and electrophysiological results argued for an amphetamine-like action of fenfluramine in those autistic children whose attention deficits are associated with motor disturbances including hyperactivity.
