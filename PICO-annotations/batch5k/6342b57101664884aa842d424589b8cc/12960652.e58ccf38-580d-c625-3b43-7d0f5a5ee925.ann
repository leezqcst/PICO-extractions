T1	Participants 0 94	Gastric dysrhythmia in infants with gastrointestinal diseases measured by epigastric impedance
T2	Participants 274 296	These types of gastric
T3	Participants 297 401	myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes
T4	Participants 429 512	non-invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity
T5	Participants 622 739	purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of impedance gastrography in control infants
T6	Participants 855 942	21 patients (age 0-2 months) and 40 healthy infants (age 0-2 months) were investigated.
T7	Participants 1222 1272	pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients
T8	Participants 1324 1403	19 of the 21 patients, high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients.
T9	Participants 1449 1483	13 out of 40 of the normal infants
T10	Participants 1510 1670	epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity, which was not found in the control infants.
T11	Participants 1750 1789	related to electrical control activity.
