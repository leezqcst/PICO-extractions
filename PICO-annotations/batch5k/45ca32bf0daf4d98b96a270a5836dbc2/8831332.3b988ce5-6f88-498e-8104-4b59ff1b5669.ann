T1	Participants 0 43	Clonidine increases the sweating threshold,
T2	Participants 57 84	reduce the gain of sweating
T3	Participants 101 229	hypothesis that clonidine produces a dose-dependent increase in the sweating threshold but does not reduce the gain of sweating.
T4	Participants 230 257	Six healthy male volunteers
T5	Participants 282 317	three separate days in random order
T6	Participants 553 665	Core temperature was measured at the tympanic membrane and mean skin temperature was determined from four sites.
T7	Participants 666 731	A chest sweating rate of 40 g.m-2.h-1 was considered significant.
T8	Participants 824 836	34 degrees C
T9	Participants 1201 1270	0.4 degree C (P < 0.05), but the increase was comparable at each dose
T10	Participants 1510 1670	the antishivering effect of clonidine results from central thermoregulatory inhibition rather than a specific peripheral action on thermogenic muscular activity
T11	Participants 1897 1968	effect of clonidine may be limited, even at high plasma concentrations.
T12	Participants 2025 2102	this response remains effective in the presence of sedatives and anesthetics.
