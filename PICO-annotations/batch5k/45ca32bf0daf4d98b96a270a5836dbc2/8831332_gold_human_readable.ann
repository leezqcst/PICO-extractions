Six healthy male volunteers were evaluated, each on three separate days in random order. In one, saline was administered; in another, a 2-micrograms/kg bolus of clonidine was followed by an infusion at 2 micrograms.kg-1.h-1, and on a third day, a 4-micrograms/kg bolus was followed by an infusion at 4 micrograms.kg-1.h-1. Core temperature was measured at the tympanic membrane and mean skin temperature was determined from four sites.
