A randomized study on hormone-resistant prostatic cancer: estramustine phosphate versus low dose epirubicin with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate. A Norwegian multicenter study.

A prospective randomized study has been carried out in order to compare three different treatment modalities for symptomatic metastatic hormone-resistant prostatic cancer. A total of 79 patients were included. One group was treated with estramustine phosphate, another with Epirubicin plus Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), while the third arm consisted of Epirubicin plus placebo. Best palliation was obtained by the combination of Epirubicin and MPA. This combination also seemed to be associated with the longest response duration.
