The immunogenicity of three Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccines after a primary vaccination series in Philippine infants.

Serum antibody responses to three Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PRP-OMP, PRP-T, and HbOC) were evaluated in 174 Philippine infants after a primary vaccination series. Children were randomized to receive one of the Hib vaccines (Hib groups) or into a control group. Vaccination was carried out at six, 10 and 14 weeks of age based on the local Expanded Program of Immunization schedule. Sera were collected at six weeks of age for the Hib groups and one month after the third dose for all subjects. Anti-Hib concentrations were determined by the Farr-type radioimmunoassay. There were no significant differences (P = 0.3626) in the prevaccination anti-Hib geometric mean concentration (GMC) among the three Hib groups. Differences in the GMC after the primary series of three doses were significant (P < 0.0001); GMC was highest for PRP-T (6.62 micrograms/ml), followed by HbOC (1.9 micrograms/ml), then PRP-OMP (1.06 micrograms/ml), and lowest for the control group (0.11 microgram/ml). We conclude that all three Hib conjugate vaccines (PRP-T, HbOC, and PRP-OMP) were immunogenic after three primary doses among Philippine infants.
