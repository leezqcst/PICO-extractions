Randomized phase II trial of high-dose 4'-epi-doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide versus high-dose 4'-epi-doxorubicin + cisplatin in previously untreated patients with extensive small cell lung cancer.

One hundred and eleven previously untreated patients with extensive small cell lung cancer were included in a prospective randomized study with the aim to assess the efficacy and tolerance of high-dose epirubicin (120 mg/m2) in combination with either cyclophosphamide (800 mg/m2; arm 1) or cisplatin (60 mg/m2; arm 2). Ninety-six patients were evaluable for response and toxicity and additional 12 patients for toxicity only. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in arm 1 and 2 were 61.4 (27/44) and 67.3% (35/52), respectively. The mean duration of remission was 4.4 months (arm 1) and 4.9 months (arm 2). The mean survival time was 6.6 months in arm 1 and 7.7 months in arm 2. WHO grade 4 toxicity was encountered in 25.5 and 15.8% of patients in arm 1 and 2, respectively. One case of cardiotoxicity resulting in the patient's death was observed in arm 1. Both combinations showed considerable antitumor activity. Toxicity was acceptable.
