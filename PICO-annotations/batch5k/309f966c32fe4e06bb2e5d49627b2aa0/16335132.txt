Phytase and 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol supplementation of broiler chickens during the starting and growing/finishing phases.

Supplemental 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol (1alpha-OHD3) has been shown to have qualitatively similar and quantitatively additive effects to exogenous phytase. Two experiments were conducted from 0 to 35 d in floor pens to determine the additive effect of phytase and 1alpha-OHD3 when supplemented to Ca- and P-deficient diets. In both experiments, at least 4 replicates per treatment (50 chicks per replicate) were used. Corn-soybean-meal-and soybean-oil-based diets were fed and birds were raised in a house impervious to ultraviolet light. During the starter phase (ST), from 0 to 18 d, chicks were fed a 23% CP diet containing 0.60% Ca and 0.47% total P (tP). During the grower/finisher phase (GF), from 19 to 35 d, birds were fed a 19% CP diet containing 0.30% Ca and 0.37% tP. A combination of 1,000 phytase units/kg of Natuphos phytase and 5 microg/kg of 1alpha-OHD3 (P+1A) was supplemented to some of the feed during the ST and GF. Diets containing adequate Ca and P were also fed during the ST (0.90% Ca, 0.68% tP) and GF (0.80% Ca, 0.67% tP). Performance characteristics and the incidence of rickets and tibial dyschondroplasia were measured at 18 and 35 d. In experiment 1, unsupplemented chicks performed well but had considerable leg problems. Chicks fed P+1A during the ST or GF did not perform as well as birds fed P+1A throughout. Birds fed P+1A throughout performed as well birds fed the adequate diets without any indication of leg problems. In experiment 2, unsupplemented birds performed similarly to unsupplemented birds in experiment 1. However, chicks fed the supplements or the control diets did not perform as well or accumulate as much bone ash as birds in experiment 1, although the diets were formulated identically in both experiments. Diets with as little as 0.30% Ca and 0.37% tP appear to be adequate for broilers older than 18 d if supplemented with the correct amounts of phytase and 1alpha-OHD3. However, there are unknown variables that may limit the potential of broilers in terms of bone mineralization and bone pathology, even when adequate diets are fed.
