Calcium channel blocker inhibition of AGE and RAGE axis limits renal injury in nondiabetic patients with stage I or II chronic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND There is a growing body of evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGE) and their receptor (RAGE) system are implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We have previously found that a long-acting calcium channel blocker, azelnidipine, but not amlodipine, improves renal injury in CKD patients. However, little is known about the effect of azelnidipine on the AGE-RAGE axis in humans. In this study, we examined whether azelnidipine addition could have renoprotective properties in hypertensive CKD patients by reducing serum levels of AGE and soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE). Thirty nondiabetic stage I or II CKD patients who had already been treated with angiotensin II receptor blockers were enrolled in this study.
HYPOTHESIS We hypothesized that azelnidipine treatment could limit renal injury partly by blocking the AGE-RAGE axis.
METHODS Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups; one group was treated with 16 mg azelnidipine and the other with 5 mg amlodipine once daily. They were followed up for 6 months.
RESULTS Proteinuria was positively correlated with circulating AGE and sRAGE levels in our subjects. Both drugs exhibited comparable and significant blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects. Although neither of them affected glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipid levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, treatment with azelnidipine, but not amlodipine, decreased circulating AGE, sRAGE, proteinuria, and urinary levels of liver-type fatty acid binding protein, a marker of tubular injury, in a BP-lowering-independent manner.
CONCLUSIONS Our present results suggest that azelnidipine may exert renoprotective properties in nondiabetic hypertensive CKD patients via its unique inhibitory effects on the AGE-RAGE axis.
