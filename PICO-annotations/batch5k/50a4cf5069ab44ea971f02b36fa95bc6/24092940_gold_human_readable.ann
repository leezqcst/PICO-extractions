455 women with invasive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and compared rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant lapatinib, trastuzumab, and their combination.

Eighty-six patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT at baseline and weeks 2 and 6 of anti-HER2 treatment. An imaging core laboratory provided central validation, and 2 independent reviewers, masked to assigned treatment arm and clinical outcomes, performed consensus (18)F-FDG PET/CT readings. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) reductions from baseline were used to measure metabolic response.
