Effects of the 810-nm diode laser on hair and on the biophysical properties of skin.

INTRODUCTION Laser therapy is clinically effective in hair removal; however, despite the development of various strategies, laser procedures still present a risk of adverse effects due to the overheating of the skin.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of 810-nm diode laser treatment on hair and on the biophysical properties of skin by using various non-invasive techniques on various parameters, including hair analysis, surface color changes, integrity of skin barrier, sebum production rate and pH level.
METHODS In this randomized, right-left comparison study, 35 women with axillary hair received single-session diode laser therapy. Hair analysis and biophysical properties of the skin were assessed before treatment and at weeks 2, 4 and 6 after the therapy.
RESULTS Hair density and thicknesses statistically significantly decreased after the first post-treatment evaluation. Regarding comparison of the biophysical properties of the skin, there was no statistically significant difference in the assessments, except for the increase determined during the second week in the erythema index in the laser-treated areas.
CONCLUSION The findings of this study showed that the diode laser can perform a significant reduction in the hair amount without significant epidermal damage, at least for a short period.
