Comparison of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser treatment with cold knife endoscopic incision of urethral strictures in male patients.

OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of visual laser ablation treatment with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in male patients with urethral strictures and to compare the effects with those obtained in patients treated with Sachse's optical urethrotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty patients aged 22 to 83 (mean age 61.8) with primary (n = 26, 52%) and recurrent (n = 24, 48%) urethral strictures 0.3 to 2.4 cm long qualified for the study. The patients were randomized into two groups: 30 men treated using visual laser ablation of urethral strictures (VLASU) with Nd:YAGlaser and 20 men treated by correction of urethral strictures using Sachse's optical urethrotomy.
RESULTS At 12-month follow-up, seven (35%) patients who underwent optical urethrotomy and 21 (70%) in the VLASU group did not require repetition of the procedure. The choice of VLASU as a method of treatment significantly decreased the probability of therapeutic failure and recurrence of urethral strictures (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION VLASU can be used as a method of treatment of this disorder. It is an effective, modern, low-invasive, and repeatable technique and is technically simple and easy to master. It can be used in cases in which introduction of a 22 Char optical urethrotome into the stricture site is impossible, as well as for treatment of multiple strictures during one procedure.
