OBJECTIVE : To assess whether non-polluting , more effective home heating ( heat pump , wood pellet burner , flued gas ) has a positive effect on the health of children with asthma. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Households in five communities in New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS : 409 children aged 6-12 years with doctor diagnosed asthma. INTERVENTIONS : Installation of a non-polluting , more effective home heater before winter. The control group received a replacement heater at the end of the trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome was change in lung function ( peak expiratory flow rate and forced expiratory volume in one second , FEV ( 1 ) ) . Secondary outcomes were child reported respiratory tract symptoms and daily use of preventer and reliever drugs. At the end of winter 2005 ( baseline ) and winter 2006 ( follow-up ) parents reported their child 's general health , use of health services , overall respiratory health , and housing conditions. Nitrogen dioxide levels were measured monthly for four months and temperatures in the living room and child 's bedroom were recorded hourly. RESULTS : Improvements in lung function were not significant ( difference in mean FEV ( 1 ) 130.7 ml , 95 % confidence interval -20.3 to 281.7 ) . Compared with children in the control group , however , children in the intervention group had 1.80 fewer days off school ( 95 % confidence interval 0.11 to 3.13 ) , 0.40 fewer visits to a doctor for asthma ( 0.11 to 0.62 ) , and 0.25 fewer visits to a pharmacist for asthma ( 0.09 to 0.32 ) . Children in the intervention group also had fewer reports of poor health ( adjusted odds ratio 0.48 , 95 % confidence interval 0.31 to 0.74 ) , less sleep disturbed by wheezing ( 0.55 , 0.35 to 0.85 ) , less dry cough at night ( 0.52 , 0.32 to 0.83 ) , and reduced scores for lower respiratory tract symptoms ( 0.77 , 0.73 to 0.81 ) than children in the control group. The intervention was associated with a mean temperature rise in the living room of 1.10 degrees C ( 95 % confidence interval 0.54 degrees C to 1.64 degrees C ) and in the child 's bedroom of 0.57 degrees C ( 0.05 degrees C to 1.08 degrees C ) . Lower levels of nitrogen dioxide were measured in the living rooms of the intervention households than in those of the control households ( geometric mean 8.5 microg/m ( 3 ) v 15.7 microg/m ( 3 ) , P < 0.001 ) . A similar effect was found in the children 's bedrooms ( 7.3 microg/m ( 3 ) v 10.9 microg/m ( 3 ) , P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION : Installing non-polluting , more effective heating in the homes of children with asthma did not significantly improve lung function but did significantly reduce symptoms of asthma , days off school , healthcare utilisation , and visits to a pharmacist.
