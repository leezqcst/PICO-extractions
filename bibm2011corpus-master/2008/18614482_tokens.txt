OBJECTIVE : To compare routine replacement of intravenous peripheral catheters with replacement only when clinically indicated. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Tertiary hospital in Australia. PARTICIPANTS : 755 medical and surgical patients : 379 allocated to catheter replacement only when clinically indicated and 376 allocated to routine care of catheter ( control group ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : A composite measure of catheter failure resulting from phlebitis or infiltration. RESULTS : Catheters were removed because of phlebitis or infiltration from 123 of 376 ( 33 % ) patients in the control group compared with 143 of 379 ( 38 % ) patients in the intervention group ; the difference was not significant ( relative risk 1.15 , 95 % confidence interval 0.95 to 1.40 ) . When the analysis was based on failure per 1000 device days ( number of failures divided by number of days catheterised , divided by 1000 ) , no difference could be detected between the groups ( relative risk 0.98 , 0.78 to 1.24 ) . Infusion related costs were higher in the control group ( mean $ A41.02 ; pound19.71 ; euro24.80 ; $ 38.55 ) than intervention group ( $ A36.40 ) . The rate of phlebitis in both groups was low ( 4 % in intervention group , 3 % in control group ) . CONCLUSION : Replacing peripheral intravenous catheters when clinically indicated has no effect on the incidence of failure , based on a composite measure of phlebitis or infiltration. Larger trials are needed to test this finding using phlebitis alone as a more clinically meaningful outcome. REGISTRATION NUMBER : Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12605000147684 .
