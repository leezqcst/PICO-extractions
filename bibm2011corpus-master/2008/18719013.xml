  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on health related quality of life. 
DESIGN: Randomised placebo controlled double blind trial. 
SETTING: General practices in United Kingdom (384), Australia (94), and New Zealand (24). 
PARTICIPANTS: Postmenopausal women aged 50-69 at randomisation; 3721 women with a uterus were randomised to combined oestrogen and progestogen (n=1862) or placebo (n=1859). 
Data on health related quality of life at one year were available from 1043 and 1087 women, respectively. 
INTERVENTIONS: Conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5/5.0 mg or matched placebo orally daily for one year. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health related quality of life and psychological wellbeing as measured by the women's health questionnaire. 
Changes in emotional and physical menopausal symptoms as measured by a symptoms questionnaire and depression by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies depression scale (CES-D). 
Overall health related quality of life and overall quality of life as measured by the European quality of life instrument (EuroQol) and visual analogue scale, respectively. 
RESULTS: After one year small but significant improvements were observed in three of nine components of the women's health questionnaire for those taking combined HRT compared with those taking placebo: vasomotor symptoms (P&lt;0.001), 
sexual functioning (P&lt;0.001), and sleep problems (P&lt;0.001). 
Significantly fewer women in the combined HRT group reported hot flushes (P&lt;0.001), 
night sweats (P&lt;0.001), 
aching joints and muscles (P=0.001), insomnia (P&lt;0.001), and vaginal dryness (P&lt;0.001) 
than in the placebo group, but greater proportions reported breast tenderness (P&lt;0.001) or vaginal discharge (P&lt;0.001). 
Hot flushes were experienced in the combined HRT and placebo groups by 30% and 29% at trial entry and 9% and 25% at one year, respectively. 
No significant differences in other menopausal symptoms, depression, or overall quality of life were observed at one year. 
CONCLUSIONS: Combined HRT started many years after the menopause can improve health related quality of life.
