OBJECTIVES : To assess whether supplementation with antioxidants , folinic acid , or both improves the psychomotor and language development of children with Down 's syndrome. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial with two by two factorial design. SETTING : Children living in the Midlands , Greater London , and the south west of England. PARTICIPANTS : 156 infants aged under 7 months with trisomy 21. INTERVENTION : Daily oral supplementation with antioxidants ( selenium 10 mug , zinc 5 mg , vitamin A 0.9 mg , vitamin E 100 mg , and vitamin C 50 mg ) , folinic acid ( 0.1 mg ) , antioxidants and folinic acid combined , or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Griffiths developmental quotient and an adapted MacArthur communicative development inventory 18 months after starting supplementation ; biochemical markers in blood and urine at age 12 months. RESULTS : Children randomised to antioxidant supplements attained similar developmental outcomes to those without antioxidants ( mean Griffiths developmental quotient 57.3 v 56.1 ; adjusted mean difference 1.2 points , 95 % confidence interval -2.2 to 4.6 ) . Comparison of children randomised to folinic acid supplements or no folinic acid also showed no significant differences in Griffiths developmental quotient ( mean 57.6 v 55.9 ; adjusted mean difference 1.7 , -1.7 to 5.1 ) . No between group differences were seen in the mean numbers of words said or signed : for antioxidants versus none the ratio of means was 0.85 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.6 to 1.2 ) , and for folinic acid versus none it was 1.24 ( 0.87 to 1.77 ) . No significant differences were found between any of the groups in the biochemical outcomes measured. Adjustment for potential confounders did not appreciably change the results. CONCLUSIONS : This study provides no evidence to support the use of antioxidant or folinic acid supplements in children with Down 's syndrome. TRIAL REGISTRATION : Clinical trials NCT00378456 .
