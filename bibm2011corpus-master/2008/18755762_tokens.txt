OBJECTIVE : To determine if a complex nursing and midwifery intervention in hospital labour assessment units would increase the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth and improve other maternal and neonatal outcomes. DESIGN : Multicentre , randomised controlled trial with prognostic stratification by hospital. SETTING : 20 North American and UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS : 5002 nulliparous women experiencing contractions but not in active labour ; 2501 were allocated to structured care and 2501 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS : Usual nursing or midwifery care or a minimum of one hour of care by a nurse or midwife trained in structured care , consisting of a formalised approach to assessment of and interventions for maternal emotional state , pain , and fetal position. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome was spontaneous vaginal birth. Other outcomes included intrapartum interventions , women 's views of their care , and indicators of maternal and fetal health during hospital stay and 6-8 weeks after discharge. RESULTS : Outcome data were obtained for 4996 women. The rate of spontaneous vaginal birth was 64.0 % ( n=1597 ) in the structured care group and 61.3 % ( n=1533 ) in the usual care group ( odds ratio 1.12 , 95 % confidence interval 0.96 to 1.27 ) . Fewer women allocated to structured care ( n=403 , 19.5 % ) rated staff helpfulness as less than very helpful than those allocated to usual care ( n=544 , 26.4 % ) ; odds ratio 0.67 , 98.75 % confidence interval 0.50 to 0.85. Fewer women allocated to structured care ( n=233 , 11.3 % ) were disappointed with the amount of attention received from staff than those allocated to usual care ( n=407 , 19.7 % ) ; odds ratio 0.51 , 98.75 % confidence interval 0.32 to 0.70. None of the other results met prespecified levels of statistical significance. CONCLUSION : A structured approach to care in hospital labour assessment units increased satisfaction with care and was suggestive of a modest increase in the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth. Further study to strengthen the intervention is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION : Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN16315180 .
