OBJECTIVE : To assess the effect of combined hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) on health related quality of life. DESIGN : Randomised placebo controlled double blind trial. SETTING : General practices in United Kingdom ( 384 ) , Australia ( 94 ) , and New Zealand ( 24 ) . PARTICIPANTS : Postmenopausal women aged 50-69 at randomisation ; 3721 women with a uterus were randomised to combined oestrogen and progestogen ( n=1862 ) or placebo ( n=1859 ) . Data on health related quality of life at one year were available from 1043 and 1087 women , respectively. INTERVENTIONS : Conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5/5.0 mg or matched placebo orally daily for one year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Health related quality of life and psychological wellbeing as measured by the women 's health questionnaire. Changes in emotional and physical menopausal symptoms as measured by a symptoms questionnaire and depression by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies depression scale ( CES-D ) . Overall health related quality of life and overall quality of life as measured by the European quality of life instrument ( EuroQol ) and visual analogue scale , respectively. RESULTS : After one year small but significant improvements were observed in three of nine components of the women 's health questionnaire for those taking combined HRT compared with those taking placebo : vasomotor symptoms ( P < 0.001 ) , sexual functioning ( P < 0.001 ) , and sleep problems ( P < 0.001 ) . Significantly fewer women in the combined HRT group reported hot flushes ( P < 0.001 ) , night sweats ( P < 0.001 ) , aching joints and muscles ( P=0.001 ) , insomnia ( P < 0.001 ) , and vaginal dryness ( P < 0.001 ) than in the placebo group , but greater proportions reported breast tenderness ( P < 0.001 ) or vaginal discharge ( P < 0.001 ) . Hot flushes were experienced in the combined HRT and placebo groups by 30 % and 29 % at trial entry and 9 % and 25 % at one year , respectively. No significant differences in other menopausal symptoms , depression , or overall quality of life were observed at one year. CONCLUSIONS : Combined HRT started many years after the menopause can improve health related quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION : ISRCTN 63718836 .
