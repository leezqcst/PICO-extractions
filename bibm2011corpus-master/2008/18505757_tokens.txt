OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effectiveness of a voluntary sector based befriending scheme in improving psychological wellbeing and quality of life for family carers of people with dementia. DESIGN : Single blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Community settings in East Anglia and London. PARTICIPANTS : 236 family carers of people with primary progressive dementia. INTERVENTION : Contact with a befriender facilitator and offer of match with a trained lay volunteer befriender compared with no befriender facilitator contact ; all participants continued to receive `` usual care. '' MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Carers ' mood ( hospital anxiety and depression scale-depression ) and health related quality of life ( EuroQoL ) at 15 months post-randomisation. RESULTS : The intention to treat analysis showed no benefit for the intervention `` access to a befriender facilitator '' on the primary outcome measure or on any of the secondary outcome measures.
