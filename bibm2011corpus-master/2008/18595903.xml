  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a neuromuscular training programme is effective in preventing non-contact leg injuries in female floorball players. 
DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled study. 
SETTING: 28 top level female floorball teams in Finland. 
PARTICIPANTS: 457 players (mean age 24 years)-256 (14 teams) in the intervention group and 201 (14 teams) in the control group-followedup for one league season (six months). 
INTERVENTION: A neuromuscular training programme to enhance players' motor skills and body control, as well as to activate and prepare their neuromuscular system for sports specific manoeuvres. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Acute non-contact injuries of the legs. 
RESULTS: During the season, 72 acute non-contact leg injuries occurred, 20 in the intervention group and 52 in the control group. 
The injury incidence per 1000 hours playing and practise in the intervention group was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.13) and in the control group was 2.08 (1.58 to 2.72). 
The risk of non-contact leg injury was 66% lower (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.57) in the intervention group. 
CONCLUSION: A neuromuscular training programme was effective in preventing acute non-contact injuries of the legs in female floorball players. 
Neuromuscular training can be recommended in the weekly training of these athletes.
