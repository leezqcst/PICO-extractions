OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of pH analysis of fetal scalp blood compared with lactate analysis in identifying hypoxia in labour to prevent acidaemia at birth. 
DESIGN: Randomised controlled multicentre trial. 
SETTING: Labour wards. 
PARTICIPANTS: Women with a singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation, gestational age >or=34 weeks, and clinical indication for fetal scalp blood sampling. 
INTERVENTIONS: Standard pH analysis (n=1496) or lactate analysis (n=1496) with an electrochemical microvolume (5 mul) test strip device. 
The cut-off levels for intervention were pH <7.21 and lactate >4.8 mmol/l, respectively. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Metabolic acidaemia (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/l) or pH <7.00 in cord artery blood. 
RESULTS: Metabolic acidaemia occurred in 3.2% in the lactate group and in 3.6% in the pH group (relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.36). 
pH <7.00 
occurred in 1.5% in the lactate group and in 1.8% in the pH group (0.84, 0.47 to 1.50). 
There was no significant difference in Apgar scores <7 at 5 minutes (1.15, 0.76 to 1.75) or operative deliveries for fetal distress (1.02, 0.93 to 1.11). 
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in rate of acidaemia at birth after use of lactate analysis or pH analysis of fetal scalp blood samples to determine hypoxia during labour.
