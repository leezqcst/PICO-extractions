  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a voluntary sector based befriending scheme in improving psychological wellbeing and quality of life for family carers of people with dementia. 
DESIGN: Single blind randomised controlled trial. 
SETTING: Community settings in East Anglia and London. 
PARTICIPANTS: 236 family carers of people with primary progressive dementia. 
INTERVENTION: Contact with a befriender facilitator and offer of match with a trained lay volunteer befriender compared with no befriender facilitator contact; all participants continued to receive "usual care." 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Carers' mood (hospital anxiety and depression scale-depression) and health related quality of life (EuroQoL) at 15 months post-randomisation. 
RESULTS: The intention to treat analysis showed no benefit for the intervention "access to a befriender facilitator" on the primary outcome measure or on any of the secondary outcome measures. 
CONCLUSIONS: In common with many carers' services, befriending schemes are not taken up by all carers, and providing access to a befriending scheme is not effective in improving wellbeing.
