OBJECTIVE : To assess the impact of prophylactic oral co-trimoxazole in reducing mortality in HIV positive Zambian adults being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis. DESIGN : Double blind placebo controlled randomised clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS : Two groups of antiretroviral treatment naive adults with HIV infection : patients newly diagnosed as having tuberculosis and receiving tuberculosis treatment either for the first time or for retreatment after relapse ; previously treated patients not receiving treatment. INTERVENTION : Oral co-trimoxazole or matching placebo daily. Primary outcome measures Time to death and occurrence of serious adverse events related to study drug. RESULTS : 1003 patients were randomised : 835 ( 416 co-trimoxazole , 419 placebo ) were receiving treatment for tuberculosis , 762 ( 376 co-trimoxazole , 386 placebo ) of them newly diagnosed previously untreated patients and 73 ( 40 co-trimoxazole , 33 placebo ) receiving a retreatment regimen ; 168 ( 84 co-trimoxazole , 84 placebo ) were not on treatment but had received treatment in the past. Of 835 participants receiving tuberculosis treatment , follow-up information was available for 757 , with a total of 1012.6 person years of follow-up. A total of 310 ( 147 co-trimoxazole , 163 placebo ) participants died , corresponding to death rates of 27.3 and 34.4 per 100 person years. In the Cox regression analysis , the hazard ratio for death ( co-trimoxazole : placebo ) was 0.79 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.63 to 0.99 ) . The effect of co-trimoxazole waned with time , possibly owing to falling adherence levels ; in a per protocol analysis based on patients who spent at least 90 % of their time at risk supplied with study drug , the hazard ratio was 0.65 ( 0.45 to 0.93 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole reduces mortality in HIV infected adults with pulmonary tuberculosis. Co-trimoxazole was generally safe and well tolerated.
