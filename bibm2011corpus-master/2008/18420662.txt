OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of self monitoring of blood glucose concentrations on glycaemic control and psychological indices in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial of self monitoring versus no monitoring (control). 
SETTING: Hospital diabetes clinics. 
PARTICIPANTS: 184 (111 men) people aged <70 with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes referred to the participating diabetes clinics. 
Major exclusion criteria were secondary diabetes, insulin treatment, previous self monitoring of blood glucose. 
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to self monitoring or no monitoring (control) groups for one year with follow-up at three monthly intervals. 
Both groups underwent an identical structured core education programme. 
The self monitoring group received additional education on monitoring. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between group differences in HbA(1c), psychological indices, use of oral hypoglycaemic drugs, body mass index (BMI), and reported hypoglycaemia rates. 
RESULTS: 96 patients (55 men) were randomised to monitoring and 88 (56 men) to control. 
There were no baseline differences in mean (SD) age (57.7 (11.0) in monitoring group v 60.9 (11.5) in control group) or HbA(1c) (8.8 (2.1)% v 8.6 (2.3)%, respectively). 
Those in the monitoring group had a higher baseline BMI (34 (7) v 32 (6.2)). 
There were no significant differences between groups at any time point (12 months values given) in HbA(1c) (6.9 (0.8)% v 6.9 (1.2)%, P=0.69; 95% confidence interval for difference -0.25% to 0.38%), BMI (33.1 (6.4) v 31.8 (6.0); adjusted for baseline BMI, P=0.32), use of oral hypoglycaemic drugs, or reported incidence of hypoglycaemia. 
Monitoring was associated with a 6% higher score on the depression subscale of the well-being questionnaire (P=0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes self monitoring of blood glucose concentration has no effect on glycaemic control but is associated with higher scores on a depression subscale.
