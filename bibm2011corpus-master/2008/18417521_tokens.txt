OBJECTIVE : To determine whether introducing a rapid test for meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) screening leads to a reduction in MRSA acquisition on hospital general wards. DESIGN : Cluster randomised crossover trial. SETTING : Medical , surgical , elderly care , and oncology wards of a London teaching hospital on two sites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : MRSA acquisition rate ( proportion of patients negative for MRSA who became MRSA positive ) . PARTICIPANTS : All patients admitted to the study wards who were MRSA negative on admission and screened for MRSA on discharge. INTERVENTION : Rapid polymerase chain reaction based screening test for MRSA compared with conventional culture. RESULTS : Of 9608 patients admitted to study wards , 8374 met entry criteria and 6888 had full data ( 82.3 % ) ; 3335 in the control arm and 3553 in the rapid test arm. The overall MRSA carriage rate on admission was 6.7 % . Rapid tests led to a reduction in median reporting time from admission , from 46 to 22 hours ( P < 0.001 ) . Rapid testing also reduced the number of inappropriate pre-emptive isolation days between the control and intervention arms ( 399 v 277 , P < 0.001 ) . This was not seen in other measurements of resource use. MRSA was acquired by 108 ( 3.2 % ) patients in the control arm and 99 ( 2.8 % ) in the intervention arm. When predefined confounding factors were taken into account the adjusted odds ratio was 0.91 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.61 to 1.234 ) . Rates of MRSA transmission , wound infection , and bacteraemia were not statistically different between the two arms. CONCLUSION : A rapid test for MRSA led to the quick receipt of results and had an impact on bed usage. No evidence was found of a significant reduction in MRSA acquisition and on these data it is unlikely that the increased costs of rapid tests can be justified compared with alternative control measures against MRSA.
