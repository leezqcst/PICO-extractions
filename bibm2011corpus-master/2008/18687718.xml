  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of clomifene citrate and unstimulated intrauterine insemination with expectant management for the treatment of unexplained infertility. 
DESIGN: Three arm parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. 
SETTING: Four teaching hospitals and a district general hospital in Scotland. 
PARTICIPANTS: Couples with infertility for over two years, confirmed ovulation, patent fallopian tubes, and motile sperm. 
INTERVENTION: Expectant management, oral clomifene citrate, and unstimulated intrauterine insemination. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was live birth. 
Secondary outcome measures included clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and acceptability. 
RESULTS: 580 women were randomised to expectant management (n=193), oral clomifene citrate (n=194), or unstimulated intrauterine insemination (n=193) for six months. 
The three randomised groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, duration of infertility, sperm concentration, and motility. 
Live birth rates were 32/193 (17%), 26/192 (14%), and 43/191 (23%), respectively. 
Compared with expectant management, the odds ratio for a live birth was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.38) after clomifene citrate and 1.46 (0.88 to 2.43) after unstimulated intrauterine insemination. 
More women randomised to clomifene citrate (159/170, 94%) and unstimulated intrauterine insemination (155/162, 96%) found the process of treatment acceptable than those randomised to expectant management (123/153, 80%) (P=0.001 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). 
CONCLUSION: In couples with unexplained infertility existing treatments such as empirical clomifene and unstimulated intrauterine insemination are unlikely to offer superior live birth rates compared with expectant management.
