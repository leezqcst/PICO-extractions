OBJECTIVE : To determine the relative benefits and risks of laparoscopic fundoplication surgery as an alternative to long term drug treatment for chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) . DESIGN : Multicentre , pragmatic randomised trial ( with parallel preference groups ) . SETTING : 21 hospitals in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS : 357 randomised participants ( 178 surgical , 179 medical ) and 453 preference participants ( 261 , 192 ) ; mean age 46 ; 66 % men. All participants had documented evidence of GORD and symptoms for > 12 months. INTERVENTION : The type of laparoscopic fundoplication used was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Those allocated to medical treatment had their treatment reviewed and adjusted as necessary by a local gastroenterologist , and subsequent clinical management was at the discretion of the clinician responsible for care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The disease specific REFLUX quality of life score ( primary outcome ) , SF-36 , EQ-5D , and medication use , measured at time points equivalent to three and 12 months after surgery , and surgical complications. MAIN RESULTS : Randomised participants had received drugs for GORD for median of 32 months before trial entry. Baseline REFLUX scores were 63.6 ( SD 24.1 ) and 66.8 ( SD 24.5 ) in the surgical and medical randomised groups , respectively. Of those randomised to surgery , 111 ( 62 % ) actually had total or partial fundoplication. Surgical complications were uncommon with a conversion rate of 0.6 % and no mortality. By 12 months , 38 % ( 59/154 ) randomised to surgery ( 14 % ( 14/104 ) among those who had fundoplication ) were taking reflux medication versus 90 % ( 147/164 ) randomised medical management. The REFLUX score favoured the randomised surgical group ( 14.0 , 95 % confidence interval 9.6 to 18.4 ; P < 0.001 ) . Differences of a third to half of 1 SD in other health status measures also favoured the randomised surgical group. Baseline scores in the preference for surgery group were the worst ; by 12 months these were better than in the preference for medical treatment group. CONCLUSION : At least up to 12 months after surgery , laparoscopic fundoplication significantly increased measures of health status in patients with GORD. TRIAL REGISTRATION : ISRCTN15517081 .
