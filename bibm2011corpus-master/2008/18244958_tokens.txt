OBJECTIVE : To determine whether a parenting programme , offered universally in primary care , can prevent behavioural problems in children and improve parenting and maternal mental health. DESIGN : Cluster randomised trial. SETTING : 40 primary care nursing centres ( clusters ) in Victoria , Australia. PARTICIPANTS : 733 English speaking mothers of 8 month old children sequentially recruited from well child appointments ; 656 retained at 24 months. INTERVENTION : Structured three session programme at age 8-15 months , co-led by well child providers and a parenting expert. The programme covered normal development and behaviour , strategies to increase desired behaviour , and strategies to reduce unwanted behaviour. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Maternal report of child externalising behaviour ( child behavior checklist 1 ( 1/2 ) -5 year old ) , parenting ( parent behavior checklist ) , and maternal mental health ( depression anxiety stress scales ) at 18 and 24 months. RESULTS : At 18 months , child behaviour and parenting scores were similar in the two groups. At 24 months , externalising scores in the intervention and control groups were similar ( mean 11.9 ( SD 7.2 ) v 12.9 ( 7.4 ) ) ; however , on the parent behavior checklist subscale scores , intervention group parents were less likely to report harsh/abusive parenting ( mean 38.9 ( SD 7.7 ) v 40.5 ( 8.8 ) ; adjusted mean difference -1.83 , 95 % confidence interval -3.12 to -0.55 ) and unreasonable expectations of child development ( 40.9 ( 9.9 ) v 42.7 ( 9.6 ) ; -2.18 , -3.74 to -0.62 ) . Mean scores for nurturing parenting and maternal mental health were similar in the two groups at both times. CONCLUSIONS : A universal parenting programme resulted in modest improvement in parenting factors that predict behavioural problems in children but did not reduce externalising behavioural problems or affect maternal mental health at 2 years.
