OBJECTIVE : To assess the effectiveness of an activity programme in improving function , quality of life , and falls in older people in residential care. DESIGN : Cluster randomised controlled trial with one year follow-up. SETTING : 41 low level dependency residential care homes in New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS : 682 people aged 65 years or over. INTERVENTIONS : 330 residents were offered a goal setting and individualised activities of daily living activity programme by a gerontology nurse , reinforced by usual healthcare assistants ; 352 residents received social visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Function ( late life function and disability instruments , elderly mobility scale , FICSIT-4 balance test , timed up and go test ) , quality of life ( life satisfaction index , EuroQol ) , and falls ( time to fall over 12 months ) . Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms and hospital admissions. RESULTS : 473 ( 70 % ) participants completed the trial. The programme had no impact overall. However , in contrast to residents with impaired cognition ( no differences between intervention and control group ) , those with normal cognition in the intervention group may have maintained overall function ( late life function and disability instrument total function , P=0.024 ) and lower limb function ( late life function and disability instrument basic lower extremity , P=0.015 ) . In residents with cognitive impairment , the likelihood of depression increased in the intervention group. No other outcomes differed between groups. CONCLUSION : A programme of functional rehabilitation had minimal impact for elderly people in residential care with normal cognition but was not beneficial for those with poor cognition.
