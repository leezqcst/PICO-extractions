OBJECTIVE : To compare the effectiveness of clomifene citrate and unstimulated intrauterine insemination with expectant management for the treatment of unexplained infertility. DESIGN : Three arm parallel group , pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Four teaching hospitals and a district general hospital in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS : Couples with infertility for over two years , confirmed ovulation , patent fallopian tubes , and motile sperm. INTERVENTION : Expectant management , oral clomifene citrate , and unstimulated intrauterine insemination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome was live birth. Secondary outcome measures included clinical pregnancy , multiple pregnancy , miscarriage , and acceptability. RESULTS : 580 women were randomised to expectant management ( n=193 ) , oral clomifene citrate ( n=194 ) , or unstimulated intrauterine insemination ( n=193 ) for six months. The three randomised groups were comparable in terms of age , body mass index , duration of infertility , sperm concentration , and motility. Live birth rates were 32/193 ( 17 % ) , 26/192 ( 14 % ) , and 43/191 ( 23 % ) , respectively. Compared with expectant management , the odds ratio for a live birth was 0.79 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.45 to 1.38 ) after clomifene citrate and 1.46 ( 0.88 to 2.43 ) after unstimulated intrauterine insemination. More women randomised to clomifene citrate ( 159/170 , 94 % ) and unstimulated intrauterine insemination ( 155/162 , 96 % ) found the process of treatment acceptable than those randomised to expectant management ( 123/153 , 80 % ) ( P=0.001 and P < 0.001 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : In couples with unexplained infertility existing treatments such as empirical clomifene and unstimulated intrauterine insemination are unlikely to offer superior live birth rates compared with expectant management.
