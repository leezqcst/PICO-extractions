OBJECTIVE : To compare the efficacy of oral antibiotic treatment alone with treatment started parenterally and completed orally in children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis. DESIGN : Multicentre , randomised controlled , open labelled , parallel group , non-inferiority trial. SETTING : 28 paediatric units in north east Italy. PARTICIPANTS : 502 children aged 1 month to < 7 years with clinical pyelonephritis. INTERVENTION : Oral co-amoxiclav ( 50 mg/kg/day in three doses for 10 days ) or parenteral ceftriaxone ( 50 mg/kg/day in a single parenteral dose ) for three days , followed by oral co-amoxiclav ( 50 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for seven days ) . Main outcomes measures Primary outcome was the rate of renal scarring. Secondary measures of efficacy were time to defervescence ( < 37 degrees C ) , reduction in inflammatory indices , and percentage with sterile urine after 72 hours. An exploratory subgroup analysis was conducted in the children in whom pyelonephritis was confirmed by dimercaptosuccinic acid ( DMSA ) scintigraphy within 10 days after study entry. RESULTS : Intention to treat analysis showed no significant differences between oral ( n=244 ) and parenteral ( n=258 ) treatment , both in the primary outcome ( scarring scintigraphy at 12 months 27/197 ( 13.7 % ) v 36/203 ( 17.7 % ) , difference in risk -4 % , 95 % confidence interval -11.1 % to 3.1 % ) and secondary outcomes ( time to defervescence 36.9 hours ( SD 19.7 ) v 34.3 hours ( SD 20 ) , mean difference 2.6 ( -0.9 to 6.0 ) ; white cell count 9.8x10 ( 9 ) /l ( SD 3.5 ) v 9.5x10 ( 9 ) /l ( SD 3.1 ) , mean difference 0.3 ( -0.3 to 0.9 ) ; percentage with sterile urine 185/186 v 203/204 , risk difference -0.05 % ( -1.5 % to 1.4 % ) ) . Similar results were found in the subgroup of 278 children with confirmed acute pyelonephritis on scintigraphy at study entry. CONCLUSIONS : Treatment with oral antibiotics is as effective as parenteral then oral treatment in the management of the first episode of clinical pyelonephritis in children.
