OBJECTIVE : To compare the functional results after displaced fractures of the femoral neck treated with internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty. DESIGN : Randomised trial with blinding of assessments of functional results. SETTING : University hospital. PARTICIPANTS : 222 patients ; 165 ( 74 % ) women , mean age 83 years. Inclusion criteria were age above 60 , ability to walk before the fracture , and no major hip pathology , regardless of cognitive function. INTERVENTIONS : Closed reduction and two parallel screws ( 112 patients ) and bipolar cemented hemiarthroplasty ( 110 patients ) . Follow-up at 4 , 12 , and 24 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Hip function ( Harris hip score ) , health related quality of life ( Eq-5d ) , activities of daily living ( Barthel index ) . In all cases high scores indicate better function. RESULTS : Mean Harris hip score in the hemiarthroplasty group was 8.2 points higher ( 95 % confidence interval 2.8 to 13.5 points , P=0.003 ) at four months and 6.7 points ( 1.5 to 11.9 points , P=0.01 ) higher at 12 months. Mean Eq-5d index score at 24 months was 0.13 higher in the hemiarthroplasty group ( 0.01 to 0.25 , P=0.03 ) . The Eq-5d visual analogue scale was 8.7 points higher in the hemiarthroplasty group after 4 months ( 1.9 to 15.6 , P=0.01 ) . After 12 and 24 months the percentage scoring 95 or 100 on the Barthel index was higher in the hemiarthroplasty group ( relative risk 0.67 , 0.47 to 0.95 , P=0.02. and 0.63 , 0.42 to 0.94 , P=0.02 , respectively ) . Complications occurred in 56 ( 50 % ) patients in the internal fixation group and 16 ( 15 % ) in the hemiarthroplasty group ( 3.44 , 2.11 to 5.60 , P < 0.001 ) . In each group 39 patients ( 35 % ) died within 24 months ( 0.98 , 0.69 to 1.40 , P=0.92 ) CONCLUSIONS : Hemiarthroplasty is associated with better functional outcome than internal fixation in treatment of displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients.
