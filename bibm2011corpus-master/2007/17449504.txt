OBJECTIVE: To explore the advice giving role of pharmacists during consultation for medication review with patients aged 80 or more. 
DESIGN: Discourse analysis. 
SETTING: Participants' homes. 
PARTICIPANTS: Subsample of consultations within a large randomised trial of home medication review among patients aged 80 or more who had been admitted to hospital. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent to which advice given by pharmacists was accepted and acknowledged by patients. 
RESULTS: Pharmacists found many opportunities to offer advice, information, and instruction. 
These advice giving modes were rarely initiated by the patients and were given despite a no problem response and deliberate displays of competence and knowledge by patients. 
Advice was often resisted or rejected and created interactional difficulties and awkward moments during the consultations. 
CONCLUSIONS: The advice giving role of pharmacists during consultations with patients aged 80 or more has the potential to undermine and threaten the patients' assumed competence, integrity, and self governance. 
Caution is needed in assuming that commonsense interventions necessarily lead to health gain.
