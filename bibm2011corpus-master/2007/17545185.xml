  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether recurrence of leg ulcers may be prevented by surgical correction of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression. 
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. 
SETTING: Specialist nurse led leg ulcer clinics in three UK vascular centres. 
PARTICIPANTS: 500 patients (500 legs) with open or recently healed leg ulcers and superficial venous reflux. 
INTERVENTIONS: Compression alone or compression plus saphenous surgery. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence. 
The secondary outcome was ulcer free time. 
RESULTS: Ulcer healing rates at three years were 89% for the compression group and 93% for the compression plus surgery group (P=0.73, log rank test). 
Rates of ulcer recurrence at four years were 56% for the compression group and 31% for the compression plus surgery group (P&lt;0.01). 
For patients with isolated superficial reflux, recurrence rates at four years were 51% for the compression group and 27% for the compress plus surgery group (P&lt;0.01). 
For patients who had superficial with segmental deep reflux, recurrence rates at three years were 52% for the compression group and 24% for the compression plus surgery group (P=0.04). 
For patients with superficial and total deep reflux, recurrence rates at three years were 46% for the compression group and 32% for the compression plus surgery group (P=0.33). 
Patients in the compression plus surgery group experienced a greater proportion of ulcer free time after three years compared with patients in the compression group (78% v 71%; P=0.007, Mann-Whitney U test). 
CONCLUSION: Surgical correction of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression bandaging does not improve ulcer healing but reduces the recurrence of ulcers at four years and results in a greater proportion of ulcer free time.
