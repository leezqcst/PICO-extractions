OBJECTIVE : To determine whether recurrence of leg ulcers may be prevented by surgical correction of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Specialist nurse led leg ulcer clinics in three UK vascular centres. PARTICIPANTS : 500 patients ( 500 legs ) with open or recently healed leg ulcers and superficial venous reflux. INTERVENTIONS : Compression alone or compression plus saphenous surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcomes were ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence. The secondary outcome was ulcer free time. RESULTS : Ulcer healing rates at three years were 89 % for the compression group and 93 % for the compression plus surgery group ( P=0.73 , log rank test ) . Rates of ulcer recurrence at four years were 56 % for the compression group and 31 % for the compression plus surgery group ( P < 0.01 ) . For patients with isolated superficial reflux , recurrence rates at four years were 51 % for the compression group and 27 % for the compress plus surgery group ( P < 0.01 ) . For patients who had superficial with segmental deep reflux , recurrence rates at three years were 52 % for the compression group and 24 % for the compression plus surgery group ( P=0.04 ) . For patients with superficial and total deep reflux , recurrence rates at three years were 46 % for the compression group and 32 % for the compression plus surgery group ( P=0.33 ) . Patients in the compression plus surgery group experienced a greater proportion of ulcer free time after three years compared with patients in the compression group ( 78 % v 71 % ; P=0.007 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . CONCLUSION : Surgical correction of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression bandaging does not improve ulcer healing but reduces the recurrence of ulcers at four years and results in a greater proportion of ulcer free time.
