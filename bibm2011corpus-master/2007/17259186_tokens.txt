OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether providing information about normal findings before a diagnostic test improves patients ' reassurance and reduces anxiety about symptoms. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Outpatient cardiology clinic. PARTICIPANTS : 92 patients with chest pain referred for a diagnostic exercise stress test. INTERVENTION : Before undergoing testing patients were randomised to receive standard information ( n=28 ; control group ) , a pamphlet explaining the function of the test and the meaning of normal test results ( n=30 ; pamphlet group ) , or the pamphlet and a brief discussion about the meaning of normal test results ( n=34 ; discussion group ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome was patients ' reported reassurance on a 5 item scale immediately after the test and at one month. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients still with chest pain and still taking cardiac drugs at one month. RESULTS : The mean levels of reassurance after testing and feedback from the doctor were significantly higher in the discussion group ( 42.0 , 95 % confidence interval 39.7 to 44.2 ) than in the pamphlet ( 39.2 , 36.1 to 42.3 ) and control groups ( 35.8 , 31.6 to 39.9 ) . This difference was maintained at one month. The proportion of patients still reporting chest pain at one month decreased significantly in the discussion group ( to 17 % ) and pamphlet group ( to 28 % ) but not in the control group ( to 36 % ) . A trend was for fewer patients in the discussion group to be taking cardiac drugs at one month. CONCLUSION : Providing patients with information about normal test results before testing can improve rates of reassurance and reduce the likelihood of future reports of chest pain.
