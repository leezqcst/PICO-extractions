OBJECTIVE : To determine whether low dose aspirin protects women aged 65 or more against cognitive decline. DESIGN : Cohort study within both arms of the women 's health study , a randomised , double blind , placebo controlled trial of low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer , 1992-5. SETTING : Women 's health study , 1998-2004. PARTICIPANTS : 6377 women aged 65 or more. INTERVENTIONS : Low dose aspirin ( 100 mg on alternate days ) or placebo for a mean of 9.6 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Women had three cognitive assessments at two year intervals by telephone. The battery to assess cognition included five tests measuring general cognition , verbal memory , and category fluency. The primary prespecified outcome was a global score , averaging performance across all tests. The key secondary outcome was a verbal memory score , averaging performance on four measures of verbal memory. RESULTS : At the initial assessment ( mean 5.6 years after randomisation ) cognitive performance in the aspirin group was similar to that of the placebo group ( mean difference in global score -0.01 , 95 % confidence interval -0.04 to 0.02 ) . Mean decline in the global score from the first to the final cognitive assessment was also similar in the aspirin compared with placebo groups ( mean difference 0.01 , -0.02 to 0.04 ) . The risk of substantial decline ( in the worst 10th centile of decline ) was also comparable between the groups ( relative risk 0.92 , 0.77 to 1.10 ) . Findings were similar for verbal memory ; however , a 20 % lower risk was observed for decline in category fluency with aspirin ( relative risk 0.80 , 0.67 to 0.97 ) . CONCLUSION : Long term use of low dose aspirin does not provide overall benefits for cognition among generally healthy women aged 65 or more .
