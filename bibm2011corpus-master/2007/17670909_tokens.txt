OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether antenatal breast feeding education alone or postnatal lactation support alone improves rates of exclusive breast feeding compared with routine hospital care. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : A tertiary hospital in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS : 450 women with uncomplicated pregnancies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcomes were rates of exclusive breast feeding at discharge from hospital and two weeks , six weeks , three months , and six months after delivery. Secondary outcomes were rates of any breast feeding. RESULTS : Compared with women who received routine care , women in the postnatal support group were more likely to breastfeed exclusively at two weeks ( relative risk 1.82 , 95 % confidence interval 1.14 to 2.90 ) , six weeks ( 1.85 , 1.11 to 3.09 ) , three months ( 1.87 , 1.03 to 3.41 ) , and six months ( 2.12 , 1.03 to 4.37 ) postnatally. Women receiving antenatal education were more likely to breast feed exclusively at six weeks ( 1.73 , 1.04 to 2.90 ) , three months ( 1.92 , 1.07 to 3.48 ) , and six months ( 2.16 , 1.05 to 4.43 ) postnatally. The numbers needed to treat to achieve one woman exclusively breast feeding at six months were 11 ( 6 to 80 ) for postnatal support and 10 ( 6 to 60 ) for antenatal education. Women who received postnatal support were more likely to exclusively or predominantly breast feed two weeks after delivery compared with women who received antenatal education ( 1.53 , 1.01 to 2.31 ) . The rate of any breastfeeding six weeks after delivery was also higher in the postnatal support group compared with women who received routine care ( 1.16 , 1.02 to 1.31 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Antenatal breast feeding education and postnatal lactation support , as single interventions based in hospital both significantly improve rates of exclusive breast feeding up to six months after delivery. Postnatal support was marginally more effective than antenatal education. TRIAL REGISTRATION : Clinical Trials NCT00270920 [ ClinicalTrials.gov ] .
