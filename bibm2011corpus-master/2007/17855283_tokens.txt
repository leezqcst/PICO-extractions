OBJECTIVES : To compare visual outcome in response to two prescribed rates of occlusion ( six hours a day and 12 hours a day ) . DESIGN : Unmasked randomised trial. SETTING : Research clinics in two London hospitals. PARTICIPANTS : 97 children with a confirmed diagnosis of amblyopia associated with strabismus , anisometropia , or both. INTERVENTIONS : 18 week period of wearing glasses ( refractive adaptation ) followed by occlusion prescribed ( `` patching '' ) for six or 12 hours a day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Visual acuity measured by logMAR letter recognition ; objectively monitored rate of occlusion ( hours a day ) . RESULTS : The mean age of children at study entry was 5.6 ( SD 1.5 ) years. Ninety were eligible for occlusion but 10 dropped out in this phase , leaving 80 children who were randomised to a prescribed dose rate of six ( n=40 ) or 12 ( n=40 ) hours a day. The mean change in visual acuity of the amblyopic eye was not significantly different ( P=0.64 ) between the two groups ( 0.26 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.21 to 0.31 ) log units in six hour group ; 0.24 ( 0.19 to 0.29 ) log units in 12 hour group ) . The mean dose rates ( hours a day ) actually received , however , were also not significantly different ( 4.2 ( 3.7 to 4.7 ) in six hour group v 6.2 ( 5.1 to 7.3 ) in 12 hour group ; P=0.06 ) . The visual outcome was similar for those children who received three to six hours a day or more than six to 12 hours a day , but significantly better than that in children who received less than three hours a day. Children aged under 4 required significantly less occlusion than older children. Visual outcome was not influenced by type of amblyopia. CONCLUSIONS : Substantial ( six hours a day ) and maximal ( 12 hours a day ) prescribed occlusion results in similar visual outcome. On average , the occlusion dose received in the maximal group was only 50 % more than in the substantial group and in both groups was much less than that prescribed. Younger children required the least occlusion. TRIALS REGISTRATION : Clinical Trials NCT00274664 .
