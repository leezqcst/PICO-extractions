OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder related to terrorism and other civil conflict in Northern Ireland. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Community treatment centre , Northern Ireland. PARTICIPANTS : 58 consecutive patients with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder ( median 5.2 years , range 3 months to 32 years ) mostly resulting from multiple traumas linked to terrorism and other civil conflict. INTERVENTIONS : Immediate cognitive therapy compared with a waiting list control condition for 12 weeks followed by treatment. Treatment comprised a mean of 5.9 sessions during 12 weeks and 2.0 sessions thereafter. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome measures were patients ' scores for post-traumatic stress disorder ( post-traumatic stress diagnostic scale ) and depression ( Beck depression inventory ) . The secondary outcome measure was scores for occupational and social functioning ( work related disability , social disability , and family related disability ) on the Sheehan disability scale. RESULTS : At 12 weeks after randomisation , immediate cognitive therapy was associated with significantly greater improvement than the waiting list control group in the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder ( mean difference 9.6 , 95 % confidence interval 3.6 to 15.6 ) , depression ( mean difference 10.1 , 4.8 to 15.3 ) , and self reported occupational and social functioning ( mean difference 1.3 , 0.3 to 2.5 ) . Effect sizes from before to after treatment were large : post-traumatic stress disorder 1.25 , depression 1.05 , and occupational and social functioning 1.17. No change was observed in the control group. CONCLUSION : Cognitive therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder related to terrorism and other civil conflict.
