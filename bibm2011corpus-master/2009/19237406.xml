  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of standardised consultations on patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. 
DESIGN: Open pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. 
SETTING: Primary care in France. 
PARTICIPANTS: 198 primary care rheumatologists, each of whom had to include two consecutive patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee. 
INTERVENTIONS: Standardised consultation was provided during three goal oriented visits (education on osteoarthritis and treatment management; information on physical exercises; information on weight loss) or usual care. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in body weight and in time spent on physical exercises (Baecke index) at four months. 
RESULTS: 336 patients were included (154 allocated to standardised consultation and 182 to usual care). 
Nine patients were excluded because of lack of baseline data (standardised consultation, n=8; usual care, n=1). 
At four months, taking into account the clustering effect, the decrease in weight was greater in the standardised consultation group than in the usual care group (mean -1.11 (SD 2.49) kg v -0.37 (2.39) kg; P=0.007). 
The physical activity score was higher for the standardised consultation group than for the usual care group (mean 0.20 (0.65) v 0.04 (0.78); P=0.013). 
The standardised consultation and usual care groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, except for global assessment of disease activity (0-10 numeric scale: mean -1.66 (2.26) v -0.90 (2.48); P=0.003) and pain level (0-10 numeric scale: mean -1.65 (2.32) v -1.18 (2.58); P=0.04). 
CONCLUSIONS: A structured consultation programme for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee resulted in short term improvement in weight loss and time spent on physical activity.
