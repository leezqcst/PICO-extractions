OBJECTIVE : To assess the effect of the timing of first postnatal home visit by community health workers on neonatal mortality. DESIGN : Analysis of prospectively collected data using time varying discrete hazard models to estimate hazard ratios for neonatal mortality according to day of first postnatal home visit. DATA SOURCE : Data from a community based trial of neonatal care interventions conducted in Bangladesh during 2004-5. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Neonatal mortality. RESULTS : 9211 live births were included. Among infants who survived the first day of life , neonatal mortality was 67 % lower in those who received a visit on day one than in those who received no visit ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.33 , 95 % confidence interval 0.23 to 0.46 ; P < 0.001 ) . For those infants who survived the first two days of life , receiving the first visit on the second day was associated with a 64 % lower neonatal mortality than in those who did not receive a visit ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.36 , 0.23 to 0.55 ; P < 0.001 ) . First visits on any day after the second day of life were not associated with reduced mortality. CONCLUSIONS : In developing countries , especially where home delivery with unskilled attendants is common , postnatal home visits within the first two days of life by trained community health workers can significantly reduce neonatal mortality .
