OBJECTIVE : To assess the efficacy , acceptability , and safety of a topical alkane vapocoolant in reducing pain during intravenous cannulation in adults. DESIGN : Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING : Emergency department of a metropolitan teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS : 201 adult patients ( 54 % male ) , mean ( SD ) age 58.2 ( 19.5 ) years , who required intravenous cannulation. INTERVENTIONS : Less than 15 seconds before cannulation , the skin area was sprayed with either water ( control , n=98 ) or vapocoolant ( intervention , n=103 ) , from a distance of 12 cm for 2 seconds. The intervention spray was a blend of propane , butane , and pentane. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Pain with cannulation and discomfort with spray , measured with a 100 mm visual analogue scale. RESULTS : Groups did not differ significantly in age , sex , indication for or site of cannulation , cannula size , or who cannulated the patient ( P > 0.05 ) . Median ( interquartile range ) pain scores for cannulation in the control and intervention groups were 36 ( 19-51 ) and 12 ( 5-40 ) mm , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) , and 59 ( 60 % ) and 33 ( 32 % ) reported pain scores > or=30 mm ( P < 0.001 ) . Scores for spray discomfort also differed significantly ( P < 0.001 ) because of skewing to the right within the intervention group. The median discomfort scores , however , were 0 mm in both groups. Success rates for first cannulation attempt did not differ between groups ( P=0.39 ) . Thirty four ( 39 % ) and 62 ( 62 % ) patients said they would choose the spray they received for analgesia in the future ( P=0.002 ) . At follow-up at five days , two patients in the intervention group reported transient skin redness. CONCLUSIONS : Topical alkane vapocoolant spray is effective , acceptable , and safe in reducing pain with peripheral intravenous cannulation in adults in the emergency department.
