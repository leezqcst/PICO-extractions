OBJECTIVE : To determine the clinical effectiveness of topical intranasal corticosteroids in children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. DESIGN : Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial. SETTING : 76 Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework practices throughout the United Kingdom , between 2004 and 2007. PARTICIPANTS : 217 children aged 4-11 years who had at least one practice recorded episode of otitis media or a related ear problem in the previous 12 months , and with bilateral otitis media with effusion confirmed by a research nurse using otoscopy plus micro-tympanometry ( B/B or B/C2 , modified Jerger types ) . INTERVENTION : Mometasone furoate 50 microg or placebo spray given once daily into each nostril for three months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Proportions of children cured of bilateral otitis media with effusion assessed with tympanometry ( C1 or A type ) at one month ( primary end point ) , three months , and nine months ; adverse events ; three month diary symptoms. Results 41 % ( 39/96 ) of the topical steroid group and 45 % ( 44/98 ) of the placebo group were cured in one or both ears at one month ( difference favouring placebo 4.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval -9.3 % to 18.1 % ) . Poisson regression was done with adjustment for four pre-specified covariates ( clinical severity , P=0.003 ; atopy , P=0.67 ; age , P=0.92 ; season , P=0.71 ) . The adjusted relative risk at one month was 0.97 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.74 to 1.26 ) . At three months , 58 % of the topical steroid group and 52 % of the placebo group were cured ( relative risk 1.23 , 0.84 to 1.80 ) . Diary symptoms did not differ between the two groups , and no significant harms were reported. CONCLUSIONS : Topical steroids are unlikely to be an effective treatment for otitis media with effusion in general practice. High rates of natural resolution occurred by 1-3 months.
