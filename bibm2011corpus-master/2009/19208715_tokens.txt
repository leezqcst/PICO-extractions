OBJECTIVE : To compare the cost effectiveness of nurses and doctors in performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. DESIGN : As part of a pragmatic randomised trial , the economic analysis calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios , and generated cost effectiveness acceptability curves to address uncertainty. SETTING : 23 hospitals in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS : 67 doctors and 30 nurses , with a total of 1888 patients , from July 2002 to June 2003. INTERVENTION : Diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy carried out by doctors or nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Estimated health gains in QALYs measured with EQ-5D. Probability of cost effectiveness over a range of decision makers ' willingness to pay for an additional quality adjusted life year ( QALY ) . RESULTS : Although differences did not reach traditional levels of significance , patients in the doctor group gained 0.015 QALYs more than those in the nurse group , at an increased cost of about pound56 ( euro59 , $ 78 ) per patient. This yields an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of pound3660 ( euro3876 , $ 5097 ) per QALY. Though there is uncertainty around these results , doctors are probably more cost effective than nurses for plausible values of a QALY. CONCLUSIONS : Though upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopies carried out by doctors cost slightly more than those by nurses and improved health outcomes only slightly , our analysis favours endoscopies by doctors. For plausible values of decision makers ' willingness to pay for an extra QALY , endoscopy delivered by nurses is unlikely to be cost effective compared with endoscopy delivered by doctors.
