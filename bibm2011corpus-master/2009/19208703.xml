  <fulltext>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of a topical alkane vapocoolant in reducing pain during intravenous cannulation in adults. 
DESIGN: Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. 
SETTING: Emergency department of a metropolitan teaching hospital. 
PARTICIPANTS: 201 adult patients (54% male), mean (SD) age 58.2 (19.5) years, who required intravenous cannulation. 
INTERVENTIONS: Less than 15 seconds before cannulation, the skin area was sprayed with either water (control, n=98) or vapocoolant (intervention, n=103), from a distance of 12 cm for 2 seconds. 
The intervention spray was a blend of propane, butane, and pentane. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain with cannulation and discomfort with spray, measured with a 100 mm visual analogue scale. 
RESULTS: Groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, indication for or site of cannulation, cannula size, or who cannulated the patient (P&gt;0.05). 
Median (interquartile range) pain scores for cannulation in the control and intervention groups were 36 (19-51) and 12 (5-40) mm, respectively (P&lt;0.001), and 59 (60%) and 33 (32%) reported pain scores &gt;or=30 mm (P&lt;0.001). 
Scores for spray discomfort also differed significantly (P&lt;0.001) because of skewing to the right within the intervention group. 
The median discomfort scores, however, were 0 mm in both groups. 
Success rates for first cannulation attempt did not differ between groups (P=0.39). 
Thirty four (39%) and 62 (62%) patients said they would choose the spray they received for analgesia in the future (P=0.002). 
At follow-up at five days, two patients in the intervention group reported transient skin redness. 
CONCLUSIONS: Topical alkane vapocoolant spray is effective, acceptable, and safe in reducing pain with peripheral intravenous cannulation in adults in the emergency department.
