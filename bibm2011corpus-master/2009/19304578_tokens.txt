OBJECTIVE : To assess the cost effectiveness of larval therapy compared with hydrogel in the management of leg ulcers. DESIGN : Cost effectiveness and cost utility analyses carried out alongside a pragmatic multicentre , randomised , open trial with equal randomisation. Population Intention to treat population comprising 267 patients with a venous or mixed venous and arterial ulcers with at least 25 % coverage of slough or necrotic tissue. INTERVENTIONS : Patients were randomly allocated to debridement with bagged larvae , loose larvae , or hydrogel. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : The time horizon was 12 months and costs were estimated from the UK National Health Service perspective. Cost effectiveness outcomes are expressed in terms of incremental costs per ulcer-free day ( cost effectiveness analysis ) and incremental costs per quality adjusted life years ( cost utility analysis ) . RESULTS : The larvae arms were pooled for the main analysis. Treatment with larval therapy cost , on average , pound96.70 ( euro109.61 ; $ 140.57 ) more per participant per year ( 95 % confidence interval - pound491.9 to pound685.8 ) than treatment with hydrogel. Participants treated with larval therapy healed , on average , 2.42 days before those in the hydrogel arm ( 95 % confidence interval -0.95 to 31.91 days ) and had a slightly better health related quality of life , as the annual difference in QALYs was 0.011 ( 95 % confidence interval -0.067 to 0.071 ) . However , none of these differences was statistically significant. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for the base case analysis was estimated at pound8826 per QALY gained and pound40 per ulcer-free day. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome estimates. CONCLUSIONS : Debridement of sloughy or necrotic leg ulcers with larval therapy is likely to produce similar health benefits and have similar costs to treatment with hydrogel.
