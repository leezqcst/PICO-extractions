OBJECTIVE : To compare the effectiveness of radial extracorporeal shockwave treatment with that of supervised exercises in patients with shoulder pain. DESIGN : Single blind randomised study. SETTING : Outpatient clinic of physical medicine and rehabilitation department in Oslo , Norway. PARTICIPANTS : 104 patients with subacromial shoulder pain lasting at least three months. INTERVENTIONS : Radial extracorporeal shockwave treatment : one session weekly for four to six weeks. Supervised exercises : two 45 minute sessions weekly for up to 12 weeks. Primary outcome measure Shoulder pain and disability index. RESULTS : A treatment effect in favour of supervised exercises at 6 , 12 , and 18 weeks was found. The adjusted treatment effect was -8.4 ( 95 % confidence interval -16.5 to -0.6 ) points. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the group treated with supervised exercises improved-odds ratio 3.2 ( 1.3 to 7.8 ) . More patients in the shockwave treatment group had additional treatment between 12 and 18 weeks-odds ratio 5.5 ( 1.3 to 26.4 ) . CONCLUSION : Supervised exercises were more effective than radial extracorporeal shockwave treatment for short term improvement in patients with subacromial shoulder pain.
