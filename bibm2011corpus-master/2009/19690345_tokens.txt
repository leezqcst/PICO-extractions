OBJECTIVE : To determine whether dietary intervention or knee strengthening exercise , or both , can reduce knee pain and improve knee function in overweight and obese adults in the community. DESIGN : Pragmatic factorial randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Five general practices in Nottingham. PARTICIPANTS : 389 men and women aged 45 and over with a body mass index ( BMI ) of > or = 28.0 and self reported knee pain. INTERVENTIONS : Participants were randomised to dietary intervention plus quadriceps strengthening exercises ; dietary intervention alone ; quadriceps strengthening exercises alone ; advice leaflet only ( control group ) . Dietary intervention consisted of individualised healthy eating advice that would reduce normal intake by 2.5 MJ ( 600 kcal ) a day. Interventions were delivered at home visits over a two year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome was severity of knee pain scored with the Western Ontario McMaster ( WOMAC ) osteoarthritis index at 6 , 12 , and 24 months. Secondary outcomes ( all at 24 months ) included WOMAC knee physical function and stiffness scores and selected domains on the SF-36 and the hospital anxiety and depression index. RESULTS : 289 ( 74 % ) participants completed the trial. There was a significant reduction in knee pain in the knee exercise groups compared with those in the non-exercise groups at 24 months ( percentage risk difference 11.61 , 95 % confidence interval 1.81 % to 21.41 % ) . The absolute effect size ( 0.25 ) was moderate. The number needed to treat to benefit from a > or = 30 % improvement in knee pain at 24 months was 9 ( 5 to 55 ) . In those randomised to knee exercise improvement in function was evident at 24 months ( mean difference -3.64 , -6.01 to -1.27 ) . The mean difference in weight loss at 24 months in the dietary intervention group compared with no dietary intervention was 2.95 kg ( 1.44 to 4.46 ) ; for exercise versus no exercise the difference was 0.43 kg ( -0.82 to 1.68 ) . This difference in weight loss was not associated with improvement in knee pain or function but was associated with a reduction in depression ( absolute effect size 0.19 ) . CONCLUSIONS : A home based , self managed programme of simple knee strengthening exercises over a two year period can significantly reduce knee pain and improve knee function in overweight and obese people with knee pain. A moderate sustained weight loss is achievable with dietary intervention and is associated with reduced depression but is without apparent influence on pain or function.
