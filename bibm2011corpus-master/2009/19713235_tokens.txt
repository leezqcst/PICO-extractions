OBJECTIVE : To determine the effectiveness of increasing the dietary content of soluble fibre ( psyllium ) or insoluble fibre ( bran ) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial. SETTING : General practice. PARTICIPANTS : 275 patients aged 18-65 years with irritable bowel syndrome. INTERVENTIONS : 12 weeks of treatment with 10 g psyllium ( n=85 ) , 10 g bran ( n=97 ) , or 10 g placebo ( rice flour ) ( n=93 ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary end point was adequate symptom relief during at least two weeks in the previous month , analysed after one , two , and three months of treatment to assess both short term and sustained effectiveness. Secondary end points included irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score , severity of abdominal pain , and irritable bowel syndrome quality of life scale. RESULTS : The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the psyllium group than in the placebo group during the first month ( 57 % v 35 % ; relative risk 1.60 , 95 % confidence interval 1.13 to 2.26 ) and the second month of treatment ( 59 % v 41 % ; 1.44 , 1.02 to 2.06 ) . Bran was more effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only ( 57 % v 32 % ; 1.70 , 1.12 to 2.57 ) , but this was not statistically significant in the worst case analysis ( 1.45 , 0.97 to 2.16 ) . After three months of treatment , symptom severity in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points , compared with 49 points in the placebo group ( P=0.03 ) and 58 points in the bran group ( P=0.61 versus placebo ) . No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Fifty four ( 64 % ) of the patients allocated to psyllium , 54 ( 56 % ) in the bran group , and 56 ( 60 % ) in the placebo group completed the three month treatment period. Early dropout was most common in the bran group ; the main reason was that the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome worsened. CONCLUSIONS : Psyllium offers benefits in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION : Clinical trials NCT00189033 .
