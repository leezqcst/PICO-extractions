OBJECTIVE : To determine whether modifying eating behaviour with use of a feedback device facilitates weight loss in obese adolescents. DESIGN : Randomised controlled trial with 12 month intervention. SETTING : Hospital based obesity clinic. PARTICIPANTS : 106 newly referred obese young people aged 9-17. INTERVENTIONS : A computerised device , Mandometer , providing real time feedback to participants during meals to slow down speed of eating and reduce total intake ; standard lifestyle modification therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Change in body mass index ( BMI ) standard deviation score ( SDS ) over 12 months with assessment 18 months after the start of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were body fat SDS , metabolic status , quality of life evaluation , change in portion size , and eating speed. RESULTS : Using the last available data on all participants ( n=106 ) , those in the Mandometer group had significantly lower mean BMI SDS at 12 months compared with standard care ( baseline adjusted mean difference 0.24 , 95 % confidence interval 0.11 to 0.36 ) . Similar results were obtained when analyses included only the 91 who attended per protocol ( baseline adjusted mean difference 0.27 , 0.14 to 0.41 ; P < 0.001 ) , with the difference maintained at 18 months ( 0.27 , 0.11 to 0.43 ; P=0.001 ) ( n=87 ) . The mean meal size in the Mandometer group fell by 45 g ( 7 to 84 g ) . Mean body fat SDS adjusted for baseline levels was significantly lower at 12 months ( 0.24 , 0.10 to 0.39 ; P=0.001 ) . Those in the Mandometer group also had greater improvement in concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( P=0.043 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Retraining eating behaviour with a feedback device is a useful adjunct to standard lifestyle modification in treating obesity among adolescents.
