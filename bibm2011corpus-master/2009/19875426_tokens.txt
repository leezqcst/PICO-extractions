OBJECTIVE : To test the effectiveness of a complex intervention designed , within a theoretical framework , to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease. DESIGN : Cluster randomised controlled multicentre trial. SETTING : General practices in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , regions with different healthcare systems. PARTICIPANTS : 903 patients with established coronary heart disease registered with one of 48 practices. INTERVENTION : Tailored care plans for practices ( practice based training in prescribing and behaviour change , administrative support , quarterly newsletter ) , and tailored care plans for patients ( motivational interviewing , goal identification , and target setting for lifestyle change ) with reviews every four months at the practices. Control practices provided usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The proportion of patients at 18 month follow-up above target levels for blood pressure and total cholesterol concentration , and those admitted to hospital , and changes in physical and mental health status ( SF-12 ) . RESULTS : At baseline the numbers ( proportions ) of patients above the recommended limits were : systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg ( 305/899 ; 33.9 % , 95 % confidence interval 30.8 % to 33.9 % ) , diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg ( 111/901 ; 12.3 % , 10.2 % to 14.5 % ) , and total cholesterol concentration greater than 5 mmol/l ( 188/860 ; 20.8 % , 19.1 % to 24.6 % ) . At the 18 month follow-up there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in the numbers ( proportions ) of patients above the recommended limits : systolic blood pressure , intervention 98/360 ( 27.2 % ) v control , 133/405 ( 32.8 % ) , odds ratio 1.51 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.99 to 2.30 ; P=0.06 ) ; diastolic blood pressure , intervention 32/360 ( 8.9 % ) v control , 40/405 ( 9.9 % ) , 1.40 ( 0.75 to 2.64 ; P=0.29 ) ; and total cholesterol concentration , intervention 52/342 ( 15.2 % ) v control , 64/391 ( 16.4 % ) , 1.13 ( 0.63 to 2.03 ; P=0.65 ) . The number of patients admitted to hospital over the 18 month study period significantly decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group : 107/415 ( 25.8 % ) v 148/435 ( 34.0 % ) , 1.56 ( 1.53 to 2.60 ; P=0.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Admissions to hospital were significantly reduced after an intensive 18 month intervention to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease , but no other clinical benefits were shown , possibly because of a ceiling effect related to improved management of the disease.
