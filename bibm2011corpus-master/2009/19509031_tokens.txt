OBJECTIVE : To assess the effectiveness of an integrated community based environmental management strategy to control Aedes aegypti , the vector of dengue , compared with a routine strategy. DESIGN : Cluster randomised trial. SETTING : Guantanamo , Cuba. PARTICIPANTS : 32 circumscriptions ( around 2000 inhabitants each ) . INTERVENTIONS : The circumscriptions were randomly allocated to control clusters ( n=16 ) comprising routine Aedes control programme ( entomological surveillance , source reduction , selective adulticiding , and health education ) and to intervention clusters ( n=16 ) comprising the routine Aedes control programme combined with a community based environmental management approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome was levels of Aedes infestation : house index ( number of houses positive for at least one container with immature stages of Ae aegypti per 100 inspected houses ) , Breteau index ( number of containers positive for immature stages of Ae aegypti per 100 inspected houses ) , and the pupae per inhabitant statistic ( number of Ae aegypti pupae per inhabitant ) . RESULTS : All clusters were subjected to the intended intervention ; all completed the study protocol up to February 2006 and all were included in the analysis. At baseline the Aedes infestation levels were comparable between intervention and control clusters : house index 0.25 % v 0.20 % , pupae per inhabitant 0.44x10 ( -3 ) v 0.29x10 ( -3 ) . At the end of the intervention these indices were significantly lower in the intervention clusters : rate ratio for house indices 0.49 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.27 to 0.88 ) and rate ratio for pupae per inhabitant 0.27 ( 0.09 to 0.76 ) . CONCLUSION : A community based environmental management embedded in a routine control programme was effective at reducing levels of Aedes infestation.
