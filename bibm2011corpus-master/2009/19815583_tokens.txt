OBJECTIVE : To determine whether collaborative requesting increases consent for organ donation from the relatives of patients declared dead by criteria for brain stem death. DESIGN : Unblinded multicentre randomised controlled trial using a sequential design. Centralised 24 hour telephone randomisation based on randomised permuted blocks of 10. SETTING : 79 general , neuroscience , and paediatric intensive care units in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS : 201 relatives of patients meeting criteria for brain stem death. Relatives were blind to the intervention and to the trial ; all other participants were necessarily unblinded. INTERVENTIONS : Collaborative requesting for consent for organ donation by the potential donor 's clinician and a donor transplant coordinator ( organ procurement officer ) compared with routine requesting by the clinical team alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Proportion of relatives consenting to organ donation. RESULTS : 101 relatives were randomised to routine requesting and 100 to collaborative requesting. All were analysed on an intention to treat basis. In the routine requesting group , 62 relatives consented to organ donation. In the collaborative requesting group , 57 relatives consented. After correction for the ethnicity , age , and sex of the potential donors the risk adjusted ratio of the odds of consent in the collaborative requesting group relative to the routine group was 0.80 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.43 to 1.53 ) , with a P value of 0.49 adjusted for interim analysis and trial over-running. The conversion rate ( donors with consent from whom any organs were retrieved ) was 92 % ( 57/62 ) in the routine requesting group and 79 % ( 45/57 ) in the collaborative requesting group ( P=0.043 ) . There were 140 approaches to relatives in the per protocol analysis , leading to 60.3 % ( 44/73 ) consent after routine and 67.2 % ( 45/67 ) after collaborative requesting ( risk adjusted odds ratio of consent 1.47 , 0.67 to 3.20 , P=0.33 ) . CONCLUSION : There is no increase in consent rates for organ donation when collaborative requesting is used in place of routine requesting by the patient 's clinician.
