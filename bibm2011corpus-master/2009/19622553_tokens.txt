OBJECTIVE : To compare the effectiveness of oral quinine with that of artemether-lumefantrine in treating uncomplicated malaria in children. DESIGN : Randomised , open label effectiveness study. SETTING : Outpatient clinic of Uganda 's national referral hospital in Kampala. PARTICIPANTS : 175 children aged 6 to 59 months with uncomplicated malaria. INTERVENTIONS : Participants were randomised to receive oral quinine or artemether-lumefantrine administered by care givers at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcomes were parasitological cure rates after 28 days of follow-up unadjusted and adjusted by genotyping to distinguish recrudescence from new infections. Secondary outcomes were adherence to study drug , presence of gametocytes , recovery of haemoglobin concentration from baseline at day 28 , and safety profiles. RESULTS : Using survival analysis the cure rate unadjusted by genotyping was 96 % for the artemether-lumefantrine group compared with 64 % for the quinine group ( hazard ratio 10.7 , 95 % confidence interval 3.3 to 35.5 , P=0.001 ) . In the quinine group 69 % ( 18/26 ) of parasitological failures were due to recrudescence compared with none in the artemether-lumefantrine group. The mean adherence to artemether-lumefantrine was 94.5 % compared with 85.4 % to quinine ( P=0.0008 ) . Having adherence levels of 80 % or more was associated with a decreased risk of treatment failure ( 0.44 , 0.19 to 1.02 , P=0.06 ) . Adverse events did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS : The effectiveness of a seven day course of quinine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ugandan children was significantly lower than that of artemether-lumefantrine. These findings question the advisability of the recommendation for quinine therapy for uncomplicated malaria in Africa. TRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00540202 .
