OBJECTIVE : To examine whether students use or avoid newly shaded areas created by shade sails installed at schools. DESIGN : Cluster randomised controlled trial with secondary schools as the unit of randomisation. SETTING : 51 secondary schools with limited available shade , in Australia , assessed over two spring and summer terms. PARTICIPANTS : Students outside at lunch times. INTERVENTION : Purpose built shade sails were installed in winter 2005 at full sun study sites to increase available shade for students in the school grounds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Mean number of students using the primary study sites during weekly observations at lunch time. RESULTS : Over the study period the mean change in students using the primary study site from pre-test to post-test was 2.63 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.87 to 4.39 ) students in intervention schools and -0.03 ( -1.16 to 1.09 ) students in control schools. The difference in mean change between groups was 2.67 ( 0.65 to 4.68 ) students ( P=0.011 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Students used rather than avoided newly shaded areas provided by purpose built shade sails at secondary schools in this trial , suggesting a practical means of reducing adolescents ' exposure to ultraviolet radiation. TRIAL REGISTRATION : Exempt .
