OBJECTIVE : To determine the effectiveness of a single application of topical chloramphenicol ointment in preventing wound infection after minor dermatological surgery. DESIGN : Prospective randomised placebo controlled double blind multicentre trial. SETTING : Primary care in a regional centre in Queensland , Australia. PARTICIPANTS : 972 minor surgery patients. INTERVENTIONS : A single topical dose of chloramphenicol ( n=488 ) or paraffin ointment ( n=484 ; placebo ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Incidence of infection. RESULTS : The incidence of infection in the chloramphenicol group ( 6.6 % ; 95 % confidence interval 4.9 to 8.8 ) was significantly lower than that in the control group ( 11.0 % ; 7.9 to 15.1 ) ( P=0.010 ) . The absolute reduction in infection rate was 4.4 % , the relative reduction was 40 % , and the relative risk of wound infection in the control group was 1.7 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.1 to 2.5 ) times higher than in the intervention group. The number needed to treat was 22.8. CONCLUSION : Application of a single dose of topical chloramphenicol to high risk sutured wounds after minor surgery produces a moderate absolute reduction in infection rate that is statistically but not clinically significant.
