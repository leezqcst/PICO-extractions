OBJECTIVES : To test the hypothesis that nurse led follow-up programmes are effective and cost effective in improving quality of life after discharge from intensive care. DESIGN : A pragmatic , non-blinded , multicentre , randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Three UK hospitals ( two teaching hospitals and one district general hospital ) . PARTICIPANTS : 286 patients aged > or=18 years were recruited after discharge from intensive care between September 2006 and October 2007. INTERVENTION : Nurse led intensive care follow-up programmes versus standard care. Main outcome measure ( s ) Health related quality of life ( measured with the SF-36 questionnaire ) at 12 months after randomisation. A cost effectiveness analysis was also performed. RESULTS : 286 patients were recruited and 192 completed one year follow-up. At 12 months , there was no evidence of a difference in the SF-36 physical component score ( mean 42.0 ( SD 10.6 ) v 40.8 ( SD 11.9 ) , effect size 1.1 ( 95 % CI -1.9 to 4.2 ) , P=0.46 ) or the SF-36 mental component score ( effect size 0.4 ( -3.0 to 3.7 ) , P=0.83 ) . There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes or subgroup analyses. Follow-up programmes were significantly more costly than standard care and are unlikely to be considered cost effective. CONCLUSIONS : A nurse led intensive care follow-up programme showed no evidence of being effective or cost effective in improving patients ' quality of life in the year after discharge from intensive care. Further work should focus on the roles of early physical rehabilitation , delirium , cognitive dysfunction , and relatives in recovery from critical illness. Intensive care units should review their follow-up programmes in light of these results. TRIAL REGISTRATION : ISRCTN 24294750 .
