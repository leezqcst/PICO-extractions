OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the impact of standardised consultations on patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. DESIGN : Open pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING : Primary care in France. PARTICIPANTS : 198 primary care rheumatologists , each of whom had to include two consecutive patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee. INTERVENTIONS : Standardised consultation was provided during three goal oriented visits ( education on osteoarthritis and treatment management ; information on physical exercises ; information on weight loss ) or usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Change in body weight and in time spent on physical exercises ( Baecke index ) at four months. RESULTS : 336 patients were included ( 154 allocated to standardised consultation and 182 to usual care ) . Nine patients were excluded because of lack of baseline data ( standardised consultation , n=8 ; usual care , n=1 ) . At four months , taking into account the clustering effect , the decrease in weight was greater in the standardised consultation group than in the usual care group ( mean -1.11 ( SD 2.49 ) kg v -0.37 ( 2.39 ) kg ; P=0.007 ) . The physical activity score was higher for the standardised consultation group than for the usual care group ( mean 0.20 ( 0.65 ) v 0.04 ( 0.78 ) ; P=0.013 ) . The standardised consultation and usual care groups did not differ in secondary outcomes , except for global assessment of disease activity ( 0-10 numeric scale : mean -1.66 ( 2.26 ) v -0.90 ( 2.48 ) ; P=0.003 ) and pain level ( 0-10 numeric scale : mean -1.65 ( 2.32 ) v -1.18 ( 2.58 ) ; P=0.04 ) . CONCLUSIONS : A structured consultation programme for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee resulted in short term improvement in weight loss and time spent on physical activity.
