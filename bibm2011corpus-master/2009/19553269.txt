OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the mortality benefit from screening men aged 65-74 for abdominal aortic aneurysm decreases over time, and to estimate the long term cost effectiveness of screening. 
DESIGN: Randomised trial with 10 years of follow-up. 
SETTING: Four centres in the UK. Screening and surveillance was delivered mainly in primary care settings, with follow-up and surgery offered in hospitals. 
PARTICIPANTS: Population based sample of 67 770 men aged 65-74. 
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were individually allocated to invitation to ultrasound screening (invited group) or to a control group not offered screening. 
Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm detected at screening underwent surveillance and were offered surgery if they met predefined criteria. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and costs related to abdominal aortic aneurysm, and cost per life year gained. 
RESULTS: Over 10 years 155 deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm (absolute risk 0.46%) occurred in the invited group and 296 (0.87%) in the control group (relative risk reduction 48%, 95% confidence interval 37% to 57%). 
The degree of benefit seen in earlier years of follow-up was maintained in later years. 
Based on the 10 year trial data, the incremental cost per man invited to screening was pound100 (95% confidence interval pound82 to pound118), leading to an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of pound7600 ( pound5100 to pound13,000) per life year gained. 
However, the incidence of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in those originally screened as normal increased noticeably after eight years. 
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality benefit of screening men aged 65-74 for abdominal aortic aneurysm is maintained up to 10 years and cost effectiveness becomes more favourable over time. 
To maximise the benefit from a screening programme, emphasis should be placed on achieving a high initial rate of attendance and good adherence to clinical follow-up, preventing delays in undertaking surgery, and maintaining a low operative mortality after elective surgery. 
On the basis of current evidence, rescreening of those originally screened as normal is not justified.
