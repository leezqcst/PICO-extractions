Physical activity to prevent obesity in young children : cluster randomised controlled trial . To assess whether a physical activity intervention reduces body mass index in young children . Cluster randomised controlled single blinded trial over 12 months . 30 6 nurseries in Glasgow , Scotland . 545 children in their preschool year , mean age 4.2 years ( SD 0.2 ) at baseline . Enhanced physical activity programme in nursery ( 3 30 minute sessions a week over 24 weeks ) plus home based health education aimed at increasing physical activity through play and reducing sedentary behaviour . Body mass index , expressed as a standard deviation score relative to UK 1990 reference data . Secondary measures were objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour ; fundamental movement skills ; and evaluation of the process . Group allocation had no significant effect on the primary outcome measure at 6 and 12 months or on measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour by accelerometry . Children in the intervention group had significantly higher performance in movement skills tests than control children at 6 month follow - up ( P = 0.0027 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.3 to 1.3 ) after adjustment for sex and baseline performance . Physical activity can significantly improve motor skills but did not reduce body mass index in young children in this trial . Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN36363490 .
