Effectiveness of telephone counselling by a pharmacist in reducing mortality in patients receiving polypharmacy : randomised controlled trial . To investigate the effects of compliance and periodic telephone counselling by a pharmacist on mortality in patients receiving polypharmacy . 2 year randomised controlled trial . Hospital medical clinic . 502 of 1011 patients receiving 5 or more drugs for chronic disease found to be non - compliant at the screening visit were invited for randomisation to either the telephone counselling group ( n = 219 ) or control group ( n = 223 ) at enrollment 12-16 weeks later . Primary outcome was all cause mortality in randomised patients . Associations between compliance and mortality in the entire cohort of 1011 patients were also examined . Patients were defined as compliant with a drug if they took 80 -120 % of the prescribed daily dose . To calculate a compliance score for the whole treatment regimen , the number of drugs that the patient was fully compliant with was divided by the total number of prescribed drugs and expressed as a percentage . Only patients who complied with all recommended drugs were considered compliant ( 100 % score ) . 60 of the 502 eligible patients defaulted and only 442 patients were randomised . After 2 years , 31 ( 52 % ) of the defaulters had died , 38 ( 17 % ) of the control group had died , and 25 ( 11 % ) of the intervention group had died . After adjustment for confounders , telephone counselling was associated with a 41 % reduction in the risk of death ( relative risk 0.59 , 95 % confidence interval 0.35 to 0.97 ; P = 0.039 ) . The number needed to treat to prevent 1 death at 2 years was 16 . Other predictors included old age , living alone , rate of admission to hospital , compliance score , number of drugs for chronic disease , and non - treatment with lipid lowering drugs at screening visit . In the cohort of 1011 patients , the adjusted relative risk for death was 1.61 ( 1.05 to 2.48 ; P = 0.029 ) and 2.87 ( 1.80 to 2.57 ; P < 0.001 ) in patients with compliance scores of 34 -66 % and 0- 33 % , respectively , compared with those who had a compliance score of 67 % or more . In patients receiving polypharmacy , poor compliance was associated with increased mortality . Periodic telephone counselling by a pharmacist improved compliance and reduced mortality .
