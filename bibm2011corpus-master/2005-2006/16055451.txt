Acupuncture in patients with tension - type headache : randomised controlled trial . To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with minimal acupuncture and with no acupuncture in patients with tension - type headache . 3 armed randomised controlled multicentre trial . 28 outpatient centres in Germany . 270 patients ( 74 % women , mean age 43 ( SD 13 ) years ) with episodic or chronic tension - type headache . Acupuncture , minimal acupuncture ( superficial needling at non - acupuncture points ) , or waiting list control . Acupuncture and minimal acupuncture were administered by specialised physicians and consisted of 12 sessions per patient over 8 weeks . Difference in numbers of days with headache between the 4 weeks before randomisation and weeks 9-12 after randomisation , as recorded by participants in headache diaries . The number of days with headache decreased by 7.2 ( SD 6.5 ) days in the acupuncture group compared with 6.6 ( SD 6.0 ) days in the minimal acupuncture group and 1.5 ( SD 3.7 ) days in the waiting list group ( difference : acupuncture v minimal acupuncture , 0.6 days , 95 % confidence interval - 1.5 to 2.6 days , P = 0.58 ; acupuncture v waiting list , 5.7 days , 3.9 to 7.5 days , P < 0.001 ) . The proportion of responders ( at least 50 % reduction in days with headache ) was 46 % in the acupuncture group , 35 % in the minimal acupuncture group , and 4 % in the waiting list group . The acupuncture intervention investigated in this trial was more effective than no treatment but not significantly more effective than minimal acupuncture for the treatment of tension - type headache .
