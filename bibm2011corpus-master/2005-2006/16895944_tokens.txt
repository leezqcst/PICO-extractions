Medical outcome after immediate computed tomography or admission for observation in patients with mild head injury : randomised controlled trial . To compare immediate computed tomography during triage for admission with observation in hospital in patients with mild head injury . Multicentre , pragmatic , non - inferiority randomised trial . 39 acute hospitals in Sweden . 2602 patients ( aged > or = 6 ) with mild head injury . Immediate computed tomography or admission for observation . Dichotomised extended Glasgow outcome scale ( 1-7 v 8 ) . The non - inferiority margin was 5 percentage points . At 3 months , 275 patients ( 21.4 % ) in the computed tomography group had not recovered completely compared with 300 ( 24.2 % ) admitted for observation . The difference was - 2.8 percentage points , non - significantly in favour of computed tomography ( 95 % confidence interval - 6.1 % to 0.6 % ) . The worst outcomes ( mortality and more severe loss of function ) were similar between the groups . In the patients admitted for observation , there was a considerable delay in time to treatment in those who required surgery . None of the patients with normal findings on immediate computed tomography had complications later . Patients ' satisfaction with the 2 strategies was similar . The use of computed tomography in the management of patients with mild head injury is feasible and leads to similar clinical outcomes compared with observation in hospital . ISRCTN81464462 .
