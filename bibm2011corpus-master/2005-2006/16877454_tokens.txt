Effects of psychosocial stimulation and dietary supplementation in early childhood on psychosocial functioning in late adolescence : follow - up of randomised controlled trial . To determine whether dietary supplementation or psychosocial stimulation given to growth retarded ( stunted ) children age 9-24 months has long term benefits for their psychosocial functioning in late adolescence . 16 year follow - up study of a randomised controlled trial . Poor neighbourhoods in Kingston , Jamaica . Of 129 stunted children identified at age 9-24 months , 103 adolescents aged 17-18 were followed up . Supplementation with 1 kg milk based formula each week or psychosocial stimulation ( weekly play sessions with mother and child ) , or both , for 2 years . Anxiety , depression , self esteem , and antisocial behaviour assessed by questionnaires administered by interviewers ; attention deficit , hyperactivity , and oppositional behaviour assessed by interviews with parents . Primary analysis indicated that participants who received stimulation had significantly different overall scores from those who did not ( F = 2.047 , P = 0.049 ) . Supplementation had no significant effect ( F = 1.505 , P = 0.17 ) . Participants who received stimulation reported less anxiety ( mean difference - 2.81 , 95 % confidence interval - 5.02 to - 0.61 ) , less depression ( - 0.43 , - 0.78 to - 0.07 ) , and higher self esteem ( 1.55 , 0.08 to 3.02 ) and parents reported fewer attention problems ( - 3.34 , - 6.48 to - 0.19 ) . These differences are equivalent to effect sizes of 0.40 - 0.49 standard deviations . Stimulation in early childhood has sustained benefits to stunted children 's emotional outcomes and attention .
