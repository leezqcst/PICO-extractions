Recruiting patients to medical research : double blind randomised trial of `` opt - in `` versus `` opt-out `` strategies . To evaluate the effect of opt - in compared with opt- out recruitment strategies on response rate and selection bias . Double blind randomised controlled trial . 2 general practices in England . 510 patients with angina . Patients were randomly allocated to an opt - in ( asked to actively signal willingness to participate in research ) or opt- out ( contacted repeatedly unless they signalled unwillingness to participate ) approach for recruitment to an observational prognostic study of patients with angina . Recruitment rate and clinical characteristics of patients . The recruitment rate , defined by clinic attendance , was 38 % ( 96 / 252 ) in the opt - in arm and 50 % ( 128 / 258 ) in the opt- out arm ( P = 0.014 ) . Once an appointment had been made , non - attendance at the clinic was similar ( 20 % opt - in arm v 17 % opt- out arm ; P = 0.86 ) . Patients in the opt - in arm had fewer risk factors ( 44 % v 60 % ; P = 0.053 ) , less treatment for angina ( 69 % v 82 % ; P = 0.010 ) , and less functional impairment ( 9 % v 20 % ; P = 0.023 ) than patients in the opt- out arm . The opt - in approach to participant recruitment , increasingly required by ethics committees , resulted in lower response rates and a biased sample . We propose that the opt- out approach should be the default recruitment strategy for studies with low risk to participants .
