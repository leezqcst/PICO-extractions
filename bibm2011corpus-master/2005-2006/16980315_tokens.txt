A randomised controlled trial of acupuncture care for persistent low back pain : cost effectiveness analysis . To evaluate the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the management of persistent non - specific low back pain . Cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial . 3 private acupuncture clinics and 18 general practices in York , England . 241 adults aged 18 - 65 with non - specific low back pain of 4-52 weeks ' duration . 10 individualised acupuncture treatments over 3 months from acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine ( n = 160 ) or usual care only ( n = 81 ) . Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year ( QALY ) gained over 2 years . Total costs to the United Kingdom 's health service during the 2 year study period were higher on average for the acupuncture group ( 460 pounds sterling ; 673 euros ; 859 dollars ) than for the usual care group ( 345 pounds sterling ) because of the costs associated with initial treatment . The mean incremental health gain from acupuncture at 12 months was 0.012 QALYs ( 95 % confidence interval - 0.033 to 0.058 ) and at 24 months was 0.027 QALYs ( - 0.056 to 0.110 ) , leading to a base case estimate of 4241 pounds sterling per QALY gained . This result was robust to sensitivity analysis . The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed acupuncture to have a more than 90 % chance of being cost effective at a pound20 000 cost per QALY threshold . A short course of traditional acupuncture for persistent non - specific low back pain in primary care confers a modest health benefit for minor extra cost to the NHS compared with usual care . Acupuncture care for low back pain seems to be cost effective in the longer term . ISRCTN80764175 [ controlled - trials .com ] .
