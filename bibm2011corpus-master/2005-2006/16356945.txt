Partner notification of chlamydia infection in primary care : randomised controlled trial and analysis of resource use . To evaluate the effectiveness of a practice nurse led strategy to improve the notification and treatment of partners of people with chlamydia infection . Randomised controlled trial . 27 general practices in the Bristol and Birmingham areas . 140 men and women with chlamydia ( index cases ) diagnosed by screening of a home collected urine sample or vulval swab specimen . Partner notification at the general practice immediately after diagnosis by trained practice nurses , with telephone follow up by a health adviser ; or referral to a specialist health adviser at a genitourinary medicine clinic . Primary outcome was the proportion of index cases with at least 1 treated sexual partner . Specified secondary outcomes included the number of sexual contacts elicited during a sexual history , positive test result for chlamydia 6 weeks after treatment , and the cost of each strategy in 2003 sterling prices . 65.3 % ( 47 / 72 ) of participants receiving practice nurse led partner notification had at least 1 partner treated compared with 52.9 % ( 39 / 68 ) of those referred to a genitourinary medicine clinic ( risk difference 12.4 % , 95 % confidence interval - 1.8 % to 26.5 % ) . Of 68 participants referred to the clinic , 21 ( 31 % ) did not attend . The costs per index case were 32.55 pounds sterling for the practice nurse led strategy and 32.62 pounds sterling for the specialist referral strategy . Practice based partner notification by trained nurses with telephone follow up by health advisers is at least as effective as referral to a specialist health adviser at a genitourinary medicine clinic , and costs the same .
