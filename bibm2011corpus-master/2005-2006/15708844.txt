Acute treatment of moderate to severe depression with hypericum extract WS 5570 ( St John 's wort ) : randomised controlled double blind non - inferiority trial versus paroxetine . To investigate the efficacy of hypericum extract WS 5570 ( St John 's wort ) compared with paroxetine in patients with moderate to severe major depression . Randomised double blind , double dummy , reference controlled , multicentre non - inferiority trial . 21 psychiatric primary care practices in Germany . 251 adult outpatients with acute major depression with total score > or = 22 on the 17 item Hamilton depression scale . 900 mg / day hypericum extract WS 5570 3 times a day or 20 mg paroxetine once a day for 6 weeks . In initial non - responders doses were increased to 1800 mg / day hypericum or 40 mg / day paroxetine after 2 weeks . Change in score on Hamilton depression scale from baseline to day 42 ( primary outcome ) . Secondary measures were change in scores on Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale , clinical global impressions , and Beck depression inventory . The Hamilton depression total score decreased by mean 14.4 ( SD 8.8 ) points , corresponding to 56.6 % ( SD 34.3 % ) of the baseline value , in the hypericum group and by 11.4 ( SD 8.6 ) points ( 44.8 % ( SD 33.5 % ) of baseline value ) in the paroxetine group ( intention to treat analysis ; similar results were observed in the per protocol analysis ) . The intention to treat analysis ( lower 1 sided 97.5 % confidence limit 1.5 points for the difference hypericum minus paroxetine ) and the per protocol analysis ( lower confidence limit 0.7 points ) showed non - inferiority of hypericum and statistical superiority over paroxetine . The lower limits in both cases exceeded the pre - specified non - inferiority margin of - 2.5 points and the superiority margin of 0 . The incidence of adverse events was 0.035 and 0.060 events per day of exposure for hypericum and paroxetine , respectively . In the treatment of moderate to severe major depression , hypericum extract WS 5570 is at least as effective as paroxetine and is better tolerated .
