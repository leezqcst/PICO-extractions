Exercises to prevent lower limb injuries in youth sports : cluster randomised controlled trial . To investigate the effect of a structured warm - up programme designed to reduce the incidence of knee and ankle injuries in young people participating in sports . Cluster randomised controlled trial with clubs as the unit of randomisation . 120 team handball clubs from central and eastern Norway ( 61 clubs in the intervention group , 59 in the control group ) followed for 1 league season ( 8 months ) . 1837 players aged 15-17 years ; 958 players ( 808 female and 150 male ) in the intervention group ; 879 players ( 778 female and 101 male ) in the control group . A structured warm - up programme to improve running , cutting , and landing technique as well as neuromuscular control , balance , and strength . The rate of acute injuries to the knee or ankle . During the season , 129 acute knee or ankle injuries occurred , 81 injuries in the control group ( 0.9 ( SE 0.09 ) injuries per 1000 player hours ; 0.3 ( SE 0.17 ) in training v 5.3 ( SE 0.06 ) during matches ) and 48 injuries in the intervention group ( 0.5 ( SE 0.11 ) injuries per 1000 player hours ; 0.2 ( SE 0.18 ) in training v 2.5 ( SE 0.06 ) during matches ) . Fewer injured players were in the intervention group than in the control group ( 46 ( 4.8 % ) v ( 76 ( 8.6 % ) ; relative risk intervention group v control group 0.53 , 95 % confidence interval 0.35 to 0.81 ) . A structured programme of warm - up exercises can prevent knee and ankle injuries in young people playing sports . Preventive training should therefore be introduced as an integral part of youth sports programmes .
