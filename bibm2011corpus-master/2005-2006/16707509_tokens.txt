Management of miscarriage : expectant , medical , or surgical ? Results of randomised controlled trial ( miscarriage treatment ( MIST ) trial ) . To ascertain whether a clinically important difference exists in the incidence of gynaecological infection between surgical management and expectant or medical management of miscarriage . Randomised controlled trial comparing medical and expectant management with surgical management of first trimester miscarriage . Early pregnancy assessment units of 7 hospitals in the United Kingdom . Women of less than 13 weeks ' gestation , with a diagnosis of early fetal demise or incomplete miscarriage . Expectant management ( no specific intervention ) ; medical management ( vaginal dose of misoprostol preceded , for women with early fetal demise , by oral mifepristone 24- 48 hours earlier ) ; surgical management ( surgical evacuation ) . Confirmed gynaecological infection at 14 days and 8 weeks ; need for unplanned admission or surgical intervention . 1200 women were recruited : 399 to expectant management , 398 to medical management , and 403 to surgical management . No differences were found in the incidence of confirmed infection within 14 days between the expectant group ( 3 % ) and the surgical group ( 3 % ) ( risk difference 0.2 % , 95 % confidence interval - 2.2 % to 2.7 % ) or between the medical group ( 2 % ) and the surgical group ( 0.7 % , - 1.6 % to 3.1 % ) . Compared with the surgical group , the number of unplanned hospital admissions was significantly higher in both the expectant group ( risk difference - 41 % , - 47 % to - 36 % ) and the medical group ( - 10 % , - 15 % to - 6 % ) . Similarly , when compared with the surgical group , the number of women who had an unplanned surgical curettage was significantly higher in the expectant group ( risk difference - 39 % , - 44 % to - 34 % ) and the medical group ( - 30 % , - 35 % to - 25 % ) . The incidence of gynaecological infection after surgical , expectant , and medical management of first trimester miscarriage is low ( 2-3 % ) , and no evidence exists of a difference by the method of management . However , significantly more unplanned admissions and unplanned surgical curettage occurred after expectant management and medical management than after surgical management .
