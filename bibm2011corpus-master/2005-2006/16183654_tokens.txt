Postcards from the EDge project : randomised controlled trial of an intervention using postcards to reduce repetition of hospital treated deliberate self poisoning . To determine whether an intervention using postcards ( postcards from the EDge project ) reduces repetitions of hospital treated deliberate self poisoning . Randomised controlled trial . Regional referral service for general hospital treated deliberate self poisoning in Newcastle , Australia . 772 patients aged over 16 years with deliberate self poisoning . Non -obligatory intervention using 8 postcards over 12 months along with standard treatment compared with standard treatment alone . Proportion of patients with 1 or more repeat episodes of deliberate self poisoning and the number of repeat episodes for deliberate self poisoning per person in 12 months . The proportion of repeaters with deliberate self poisoning in the intervention group did not differ significantly from that in the control group ( 57 / 378 , 15.1 % , 95 % confidence interval 11.5 % to 18.7 % v 68 / 394 , 17.3 % , 13.5 % to 21.0 % : difference between groups - 2 % , - 7 % to 3 % ) . In unadjusted analysis the number of repetitions were significantly reduced ( incidence risk ratio 0.55 , 0.35 to 0.87 ) . A postcard intervention reduced repetitions of deliberate self poisoning , although it did not significantly reduce the proportion of individual repeaters .
