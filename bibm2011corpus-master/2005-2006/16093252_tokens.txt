Cognitive behaviour therapy in addition to antispasmodic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome in primary care : randomised controlled trial . To assess the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy delivered in primary care for treating irritable bowel syndrome . Randomised controlled trial . 10 general practices in London . 149 patients with moderate or severe irritable bowel syndrome resistant to the antispasmodic mebeverine . Cognitive behaviour therapy delivered by trained primary care nurses plus 270 mg mebeverine taken thrice daily compared with mebeverine treatment alone . Primary measures were patients ' scores on the irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale . Secondary measures were scores on the work and social adjustment scale and the hospital anxiety and depression scale . Of 334 referred patients , 72 were randomised to mebeverine plus cognitive behaviour therapy and 77 to mebeverine alone . Cognitive behaviour therapy had considerable initial benefit on symptom severity compared with mebeverine alone , with a mean reduction in score of 68 points ( 95 % confidence interval 103 to 33 ) , with the benefit persisting at 3 months and 6 months after therapy ( mean reductions 71 points ( 109 to 32 ) and 11 points ( 20 to 3 ) ) but not later . Cognitive behaviour therapy also showed significant benefit on the work and social adjustment scale that was still present 12 months after therapy ( mean reduction 2.8 points ( 5.2 to 0.4 ) ) , but had an inconsistent effect on the hospital anxiety and depression scale . Cognitive behaviour therapy delivered by primary care nurses offered additional benefit over mebeverine alone up to 6 months , although the effect had waned by 12 months . Such therapy may be useful for certain patients with irritable bowel syndrome in primary care .
