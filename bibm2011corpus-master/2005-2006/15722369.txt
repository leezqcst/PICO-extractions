Quetiapine and rivastigmine and cognitive decline in Alzheimer 's disease : randomised double blind placebo controlled trial . To determine the respective efficacy of quetiapine and rivastigmine for agitation in people with dementia in institutional care and to evaluate these treatments with respect to change in cognitive performance . Randomised double blind ( clinician , patient , outcomes assessor ) placebo controlled trial . Care facilities in the north east of England . 93 patients with Alzheimer 's disease , dementia , and clinically significant agitation . Atypical antipsychotic ( quetiapine ) , cholinesterase inhibitor ( rivastigmine ) , or placebo ( double dummy ) . Agitation ( Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory ) and cognition ( severe impairment battery ) at baseline and at 6 weeks and 26 weeks . The primary outcome was agitation inventory at 6 weeks . 31 patients were randomised to each group , and 80 ( 86 % ) started treatment ( 25 rivastigmine , 26 quetiapine , 29 placebo ) , of whom 71 ( 89 % ) tolerated the maximum protocol dose ( 22 rivastigmine , 23 quetiapine , 26 placebo ) . Compared with placebo , neither group showed significant differences in improvement on the agitation inventory either at 6 weeks or 26 weeks . 50 6 patients scored > 10 on the severe impairment battery at baseline , 46 ( 82 % ) of whom were included in the analysis at 6 week follow up ( 14 rivastigmine , 14 quetiapine , 18 placebo ) . For quetiapine the change in severe impairment battery score from baseline was estimated as an average of - 14.6 points ( 95 % confidence interval - 25.3 to - 4.0 ) lower ( that is , worse ) than in the placebo group at 6 weeks ( P = 0.009 ) and - 15.4 points ( -27.0 to - 3.8 ) lower at 26 weeks ( P = 0.01 ) . The corresponding changes with rivastigmine were - 3.5 points ( -13.1 to 6.2 ) lower at 6 weeks ( P = 0.5 ) and - 7.5 points ( -21.0 to 6.0 ) lower at 26 weeks ( P = 0.3 ) . Neither quetiapine nor rivastigmine are effective in the treatment of agitation in people with dementia in institutional care . Compared with placebo , quetiapine is associated with significantly greater cognitive decline .
