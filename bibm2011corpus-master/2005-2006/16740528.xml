  <fulltext>Pressure relieving support surfaces ( PRESSURE ) trial : cost effectiveness analysis . To assess the cost effectiveness of alternating pressure mattresses compared with alternating pressure overlays for the prevention of pressure ulcers in patients admitted to hospital . Cost effectiveness analysis carried out alongside the pressure relieving support surfaces ( PRESSURE ) trial ; a multicentre UK based pragmatic randomised controlled trial . 11 hospitals in 6 UK NHS trusts . Intention to treat population comprising 1971 participants . Kaplan Meier estimates of restricted mean time to development of pressure ulcers and total costs for treatment in hospital . Alternating pressure mattresses were associated with lower overall costs ( 283.6 pounds sterling per patient on average , 95 % confidence interval -- 377.59 pounds sterling to 976.79 pounds sterling ) mainly due to reduced length of stay in hospital , and greater benefits ( a delay in time to ulceration of 10.64 days on average , --24.40 to 3.09 ) . The differences in health benefits and total costs for hospital stay between alternating pressure mattresses and alternating pressure overlays were not statistically significant ; however , a cost effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that on average alternating pressure mattresses compared with alternating pressure overlays were associated with an 80 % probability of being cost saving . Alternating pressure mattresses for the prevention of pressure ulcers are more likely to be cost effective and are more acceptable to patients than alternating pressure overlays .</fulltext>
