Does home based medication review keep older people out of hospital ? The HOMER randomised controlled trial . To determine whether home based medication review by pharmacists affects hospital readmission rates among older people . Randomised controlled trial . Home based medication review after discharge from acute or community hospitals in Norfolk and Suffolk . 872 patients aged over 80 recruited during an emergency admission ( any cause ) if returning to own home or warden controlled accommodation and taking 2 or more drugs daily on discharge . 2 home visits by a pharmacist within 2 weeks and 8 weeks of discharge to educate patients and carers about their drugs , remove out of date drugs , inform general practitioners of drug reactions or interactions , and inform the local pharmacist if a compliance aid is needed . Control arm received usual care . Total emergency readmissions to hospital at 6 months . Secondary outcomes included death and quality of life measured with the EQ-5D . By 6 months 178 readmissions had occurred in the control group and 234 in the intervention group ( rate ratio = 1.30 , 95 % confidence interval 1.07 to 1.58 ; P = 0.009 , Poisson model ) . 49 deaths occurred in the intervention group compared with 63 in the control group ( hazard ratio = 0.75 , 0.52 to 1.10 ; P = 0.14 ) . EQ-5D scores decreased ( worsened ) by a mean of 0.14 in the control group and 0.13 in the intervention group ( difference = 0.01 , - 0.05 to 0.06 ; P = 0.84 , t test ) . The intervention was associated with a significantly higher rate of hospital admissions and did not significantly improve quality of life or reduce deaths . Further research is needed to explain this counterintuitive finding and to identify more effective methods of medication review .
