Effects of locality based community hospital care on independence in older people needing rehabilitation : randomised controlled trial . To determine the effects on independence in older people needing rehabilitation in a locality based community hospital compared with care on a ward for elderly people in a district general hospital . Randomised controlled trial . Care in a community hospital and district general hospital in Bradford , England . 220 patients needing rehabilitation after an acute illness that required hospital admission . Patients were randomly allocated to a locality based community hospital or to remain within a department for the care of elderly people in a district general hospital . Primary outcomes were Nottingham extended activities of daily living scale and general health questionnaire 28 ( carer ) . Secondary outcomes were activities of daily living ( Barthel index ) , Nottingham health profil , hospital anxiety and depression scale , mortality , destination after discharge , satisfaction with services , carer strain index , and carer 's satisfaction with services . The median length of stay was 15 days for both the community hospital and the district general hospital groups ( interquartile range : community hospital 9-25 days ; district general hospital 9-24 days ) . Independence at 6 months was greater in the community hospital group ( adjusted mean difference 5.30 , 95 % confidence interval 0.64 to 9.96 ) . Results for the secondary outcome measures , including care satisfaction and measures of carer burden , were similar for both groups . Care in a locality based community hospital is associated with greater independence for older people than care in wards for elderly people in a district general hospital .
