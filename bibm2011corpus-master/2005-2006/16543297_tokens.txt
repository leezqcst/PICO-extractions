Effect of enhanced psychosocial care on antipsychotic use in nursing home residents with severe dementia : cluster randomised trial . To evaluate the effectiveness of a training and support intervention for nursing home staff in reducing the proportion of residents with dementia who are prescribed neuroleptics . Cluster randomised controlled trial with blinded assessment of outcome . 12 specialist nursing homes for people with dementia in London , Newcastle , and Oxford . Residents of the 12 nursing homes ; numbers varied during the study period . Training and support intervention delivered to nursing home staff over 10 months , focusing on alternatives to drugs for the management of agitated behaviour in dementia . Proportion of residents in each home who were prescribed neuroleptics and mean levels of agitated and disruptive behaviour ( Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory ) in each home at 12 months . At 12 months the proportion of residents taking neuroleptics in the intervention homes ( 23.0 % ) was significantly lower than that in the control homes ( 42.1 % ) : average reduction in neuroleptic use 19.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval 0.5 % to 37.7 % ) . No significant differences were found in the levels of agitated or disruptive behaviour between intervention and control homes . Promotion of person centred care and good practice in the management of patients with dementia with behavioural symptoms provides an effective alternative to neuroleptics .
