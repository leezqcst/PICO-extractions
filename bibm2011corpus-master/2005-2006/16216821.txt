Self management of oral anticoagulation : randomised trial . To determine the clinical effectiveness of self management compared with routine care in patients on long term oral anticoagulants . Multicentre open randomised controlled trial . Midlands region of the UK . 617 patients aged over 18 and receiving warfarin randomised to intervention ( n = 337 ) and routine care ( n = from 2470 invited ; 193 / 337 ( 57 % ) completed the 12 month intervention . Intervention patients used a point of care device to measure international normalised ratio twice a week and a simple dosing chart to interpret their dose of warfarin . Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . No significant differences were found in percentage of time in the therapeutic range between self management and routine care ( 70 % v 68 % ) . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . 9 patients ( 2.8 / 100 patient years ) had serious adverse events in the self managed group , compared with 7 ( 2.7 / 100 patient years ) in the routine care arm ( chi2 ( df = 1) = 0.02 , P = 0.89 ) . With appropriate training , self management is safe and reliable for a sizeable proportion of patients receiving oral anticoagulation treatment . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration ISRCTN 19313375 .
