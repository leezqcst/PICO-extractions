Effect of multivitamin and multimineral supplements on morbidity from infections in older people ( MAVIS trial ) : pragmatic , randomised , double blind , placebo controlled trial . To examine whether supplementation with multivitamins and multiminerals influences self reported days of infection , use of health services , and quality of life in people aged 65 or over . Randomised , placebo controlled trial , with blinding of participants , outcome assessors , and investigators . Communities associated with 6 general practices in Grampian , Scotland . 910 men and women aged 65 or over who did not take vitamins or minerals . Daily multivitamin and multimineral supplementation or placebo for 1 year . Primary outcomes were contacts with primary care for infections , self reported days of infection , and quality of life . Secondary outcomes included antibiotic prescriptions , hospital admissions , adverse events , and compliance . Supplementation did not significantly affect contacts with primary care and days of infection per person ( incidence rate ratio 0.96 , 95 % confidence interval 0.78 to 1.19 and 1.07 , 0.90 to 1.27 ) . Quality of life was not affected by supplementation . No statistically significant findings were found for secondary outcomes or subgroups .
