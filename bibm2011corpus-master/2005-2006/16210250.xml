  <fulltext>Effect of incorporating a 10 minute point of care test for salivary nicotine metabolites into a general practice based smoking cessation programme : randomised controlled trial . To investigate the effect of immediate feedback from a point of care test for salivary nicotine metabolites in promoting smoking cessation and reduction in tobacco use . Prospective , operator blinded , randomised controlled trial . General dental practice , London . 100 adult smokers . Participants completed a questionnaire on smoking , undertook a clinical examination , and received counselling in smoking cessation . Saliva samples were analysed at presentation and at 8 weeks for salivary nicotine metabolites using a 10 minute semiquantitative point of care test . Smoking cessation measured by salivary nicotine metabolite values ( scale 0- 6 ) , patient feedback on the perceived value of the test ( visual analogue scale ) in quitting , and reduction in tobacco use . A higher smoking quit rate was achieved with the point of care test ( 23 % cases v 7 % controls ; P &lt; 0.039 ) , and overall tobacco use also decreased ( 68 % cases v 28 % controls ; P &lt; 0.001 ) . Baseline values for salivary nicotine metabolites did not differ between the groups ( cases , mean 4.1 , SD 1.3 and 4.3 , 1.4 ; P = 0.51 ) . 87 participants reattended at 8 weeks ( 44 cases , 43 controls ) . Mean nicotine metabolite values at 8 weeks were 2.58 ( 2.0 ) for cases and 4.29 ( 1.8 ) for controls ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . Incorporation of individualised personal feedback using a point of care test for salivary nicotine metabolites into a general practice based smoking cessation programme increased quit rates by 17 % at 8 weeks and reduced tobacco use .</fulltext>
