The REACT study : randomised evaluation of assertive community treatment in north London . To compare outcomes of care from assertive community treatment teams with care by community mental health teams for people with serious mental illnesses . Non - blind randomised controlled trial . 2 inner London boroughs . 251 men and women under the care of adult secondary mental health services with recent high use of inpatient care and difficulties engaging with community services . Treatment from assertive community treatment team ( 127 participants ) or continuation of care from community mental health team ( 124 participants ) . Primary outcome was inpatient bed use 18 months after randomisation . Secondary outcomes included symptoms , social function , client satisfaction , and engagement with services . No significant differences were found in inpatient bed use ( median difference 1 , 95 % confidence interval - 16 to 38 ) or in clinical or social outcomes for the 2 treatment groups . Clients who received care from the assertive community treatment team seemed better engaged ( adapted homeless engagement acceptance schedule : difference in means 1.1 , 1.0 to 1.9 ) , and those who agreed to be interviewed were more satisfied with service ( adapted client satisfaction questionnaire : difference in means 7.14 , 0.9 to 13.4 ) . Community mental health teams are able to support people with serious mental illnesses as effectively as assertive community treatment teams , but assertive community treatment may be better at engaging clients and may lead to greater satisfaction with services .
