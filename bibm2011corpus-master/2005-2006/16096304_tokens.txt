Randomised controlled trial of home based motivational interviewing by midwives to help pregnant smokers quit or cut down . To determine whether motivational interviewing - -a behavioural therapy for addictions - provided at home by specially trained midwives helps pregnant smokers to quit . Randomised controlled non - blinded trial analysed by intention to treat . Clinics attached to 2 maternity hospitals in Glasgow . 762 / 1684 pregnant women who were regular smokers at antenatal booking : 351 in intervention group and 411 in control group . All women received standard health promotion information . Women in the intervention group were offered motivational interviewing at home . All interviews were recorded . Self reported smoking cessation verified by plasma or salivary cotinine concentration . 17 / 351 ( 4.8 % ) women in the intervention group stopped smoking ( according to self report and serum cotinine concentration < 13.7 ng / ml ) compared with 19 / 411 ( 4.6 % ) in the control group . 15 ( 4.2 % ) women in the intervention group cut down ( self report and cotinine concentration less than half that at booking ) compared with 26 ( 6.3 % ) in the control group . Fewer women in the intervention group reported smoking more ( 18 ( 5.1 % ) v 44 ( 10.7 % ) ; relative risk 0.48 , 95 % confidence interval 0.28 to 0.81 ) . Birth weight did not differ significantly ( mean 3078 g v 3048 g ) . Good quality motivational interviewing did not significantly increase smoking cessation among pregnant women .
