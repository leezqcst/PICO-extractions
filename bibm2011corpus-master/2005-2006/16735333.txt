Effect of telephone contact on further suicide attempts in patients discharged from an emergency department : randomised controlled study . To determine the effects over 1 year of contacting patients by telephone 1 month or 3 months after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning compared with usual treatment . Multicentre , randomised controlled trial . 13 emergency departments in the north of France . 605 people discharged from an emergency department after attempted suicide by deliberate self poisoning . The intervention consisted of contacting patients by telephone at 1 month or 3 months after discharge from an emergency department for attempted suicide to evaluate the success of recommended treatment or to adjust treatment . Control patients received treatment as usual , in most cases referral back to their general practitioner . The primary outcome measures were proportion of participants who reattempted suicide , number of deaths by suicide , and losses to follow - up at 13 months ' follow - up . Secondary outcome measures were types and number of contacts with health care . On an intention to treat basis , the 3 groups did not differ significantly for further suicide attempts , deaths by suicide , or losses to follow - up : contact at 1 month ( intervention 23 % ( 34 / 147 ) v controls 30 % ( 93 / 312 ) , difference 7 % , 95 % confidence interval - 2 % to 15 % ) , 3 months ( 25 % ( 36 / 146 ) v 30 % , difference 5 % , - 4 % to 14 % ) . Participants contacted at 1 month were less likely at follow - up to report having reattempted suicide ( 12 % v 22 % in control group , difference 10 % , 2 % to 18 % ) . Contacting people by telephone 1 month after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning may help reduce the number of reattempted suicides over 1 year .
