Randomised controlled trial of acute mental health care by a crisis resolution team : the north Islington crisis study . To evaluate the effectiveness of a crisis resolution team . Randomised controlled trial . 260 residents of the inner London Borough of Islington who were experiencing crises severe enough for hospital admission to be considered . Acute care including a 24 hour crisis resolution team ( experimental group ) , compared with standard care from inpatient services and community mental health teams ( control group ) . Hospital admission and patients ' satisfaction . Patients in the experimental group were less likely to be admitted to hospital in the 8 weeks after the crisis ( odds ratio 0.19 , 95 % confidence interval 0.11 to 0.32 ) , though compulsory admission was not significantly reduced . A difference of 1.6 points in the mean score on the client satisfaction questionnaire ( CSQ -8 ) was not quite significant ( P = 0.07 ) , although it became so after adjustment for baseline characteristics ( P = 0.002 ) . Crisis resolution teams can reduce hospital admissions in mental health crises . They may also increase satisfaction in patients , but this was an equivocal finding .
