Effectiveness of treatment for alcohol problems : findings of the randomised UK alcohol treatment trial ( UKATT ) . To compare the effectiveness of social behaviour and network therapy , a new treatment for alcohol problems , with that of the proved motivational enhancement therapy . Pragmatic randomised trial . 7 treatment sites around Birmingham , Cardiff , and Leeds . 742 clients with alcohol problems ; 689 ( 93.0 % ) were interviewed at 3 months and 617 ( 83.2 % ) at 12 months . Social behaviour and network therapy and motivational enhancement therapy . Changes in alcohol consumption , alcohol dependence , and alcohol related problems over 12 months . Both groups reported substantial reductions in alcohol consumption , dependence , and problems , and better mental health related quality of life over 12 months . Between groups we found only 1 significant difference in outcome , probably due to chance : the social network group showed significantly better physical health at 3 months . Non - significant differences at 12 months in the motivational group relative to the social network group included : the number of drinks consumed per drinking day had decreased by an extra 1.1 ( 95 % confidence interval - 1.0 to 3.2 ) ; scores on the Leeds dependence questionnaire had improved by an extra 0.6 ( - 0.7 to 2.0 ) ; scores on the alcohol problems questionnaire had improved by an extra 0.5 ( - 0.4 to 1.4 ) ; but the number of days abstinent from drinking had increased by 1.2 % less ( - 4.5 % to 6.9 % ) . The novel social behaviour and network therapy for alcohol problems did not differ significantly in effectiveness from the proved motivational enhancement therapy .
