Effectiveness and acceptability of lidocaine spray in reducing perineal pain during spontaneous vaginal delivery : randomised controlled trial . To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a lidocaine spray in reducing perineal pain during spontaneous vaginal delivery . Randomised controlled trial . Consultant led obstetric unit . 185 women who had a spontaneous vaginal delivery without epidural analgesia . Topically applied local anaesthetic spray ( 93 women ) and placebo spray ( 92 women ) . Primary outcome measure was pain during delivery ( 0 - 100 scale ) . The 16 secondary outcome measures included second degree perineal trauma during delivery , trauma of the genital tract , and dyspareunia by 2 months . Lidocaine spray did not reduce pain during spontaneous vaginal delivery : mean 77 and 72 on a scale of 0- 100 in the lidocaine and placebo groups , respectively ( difference between means 4.8 , 95 % confidence interval - 1.7 to 11.2 ) . Lidocaine spray may reduce genital tract trauma during delivery , in particular second degree perineal trauma . The intervention was highly acceptable to the women and midwives . Although lidocaine spray applied to the perineum during spontaneous vaginal delivery did not reduce perineal pain , it was acceptable to both the women and the midwives .
