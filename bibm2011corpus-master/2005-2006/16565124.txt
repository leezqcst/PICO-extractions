Effectiveness of educational interventions in improving detection and management of dementia in primary care : cluster randomised controlled study . To test the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving detection rates and management of dementia in primary care . Unblinded , cluster randomised , before and after controlled study . General practices in the United Kingdom ( central Scotland and London ) between 1999 and 2002 . 3 educational interventions : an electronic tutorial carried on a CD Rom ; decision support software built into the electronic medical record ; and practice based workshops . 36 practices participated in the study . 8 practices were randomly assigned to the electronic tutorial ; 8 to decision support software ; 10 to practice based workshops ; and 10 to control . Electronic and manual searches yielded 450 valid and usable medical records . Rates of detection of dementia and the extent to which medical records showed evidence of improved concordance with guidelines regarding diagnosis and management . Decision support software ( P = 0.01 ) and practice based workshops ( P = 0.01 ) both significantly improved rates of detection compared with control . There were no significant differences by intervention in the measures of concordance with guidelines . Decision support systems and practice based workshops are effective educational approaches in improving detection rates in dementia .
