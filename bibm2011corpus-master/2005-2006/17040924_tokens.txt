Prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases in high risk social networks of young Roma ( Gypsy ) men in Bulgaria : randomised controlled trial . To determine the effects of a behavioural intervention for prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases that identified , trained , and engaged leaders of Roma ( Gypsy ) men 's social networks to counsel their own network members . A 2 arm randomised controlled trial . A disadvantaged , impoverished Roma settlement in Bulgaria . 286 Roma men from 52 social networks recruited in the community . At baseline all participants were assessed for HIV risk behaviour , tested and treated for sexually transmitted diseases , counselled in risk reduction , and randomised to intervention or control groups . Network leaders learnt how to counsel their social network members on risk prevention . Networks were followed up 3 and 12 months after the intervention to determine evidence of risk reduction . Occurrence of unprotected intercourse during the 3 months before each assessment . Reported prevalence of unprotected intercourse in the intervention group fell more than in control group ( from 81 % and 80 % , respectively , at baseline to 65 % and 75 % at 3 months and 71 % and 86 % at 12 months ) . Changes were more pronounced among men with casual partners . Effects remained strong at long term follow - up , consistent with changes in risk reduction norms in the social network . Other measures of risk reduction corroborated the intervention 's effects . Endorsement and advice on HIV prevention from the leader of a social network produces well maintained change in the reported sexual practices in members of that network . This model has particular relevance for health interventions in populations such as Roma who may be distrustful of outsiders . Clinical Trials NCT00310973 .
