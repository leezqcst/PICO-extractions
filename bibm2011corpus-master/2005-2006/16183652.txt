Randomised controlled trial of prevention of falls in people aged > or = 75 with severe visual impairment : the VIP trial . To assess the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a home safety programme and a home exercise programme to reduce falls and injuries in older people with low vision . Randomised controlled trial . Dunedin and Auckland , New Zealand . 391 women and men aged > or = 75 with visual acuity of 6/ 24 or worse who were living in the community ; 92 % ( 361 of 391 ) completed 1 year of follow - up . Participants received a home safety assessment and modification programme delivered by an occupational therapist ( n = 100 ) , an exercise programme prescribed at home by a physiotherapist plus vitamin D supplementation ( n = 97 ) , both interventions ( n = 98 ) , or social visits ( n = 96 ) . Numbers of falls and injuries resulting from falls , costs of implementing the home safety programme . Fewer falls occurred in the group randomised to the home safety programme but not in the exercise programme ( incidence rate ratios 0.59 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.42 to 0.83 ) and 1.15 ( 0.82 to 1.61 ) , respectively ) . However , within the exercise programme , stricter adherence was associated with fewer falls ( P = 0.001 ) . A conservative analysis showed neither intervention was effective in reducing injuries from falls . Delivering the home safety programme cost NZ650 dollars ( 234 pounds sterling , 344 euros , US432 dollars ) ( at 2004 prices ) per fall prevented . The home safety programme reduced falls and was more cost effective than an exercise programme in this group of elderly people with poor vision . The Otago exercise programme with vitamin D supplementation was not effective in reducing falls or injuries in this group , possibly due to low levels of adherence .
