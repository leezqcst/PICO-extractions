To assess the effect of patient completed agenda forms for the consultation and doctors ' education on identifying patients ' agendas on the outcome of consultations . Randomised controlled trial . General practices in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire , United Kingdom . 46 general practitioners and 976 patients . Education for general practitioners , with an embedded clustered randomised controlled trial of a patient agenda form . Number of problems identified , time required to manage each problem , duration of consultations , number of problems raised after the doctor considered the consultation finishe ( " by the way " questions ) , and patient satisfaction . Data were available from 45 doctors ( 98 % ) and 857 patients ( 88 % ) . The number of problems identified in each consultation increased by 0.2 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.1 to 0.4 ) with the agenda form , by 0.3 ( 0.1 to 0.6 ) with education , and by 0.5 ( 0.3 to 0.7 ) with both interventions . The time required to manage each problem was not affected . The duration of consultations with the agenda form was increased by 0.9 minutes ( 0.3 to 1.5 minutes ) and with the combined intervention by 1.9 minutes ( 1.0 to 2.8 minutes ) . Patient satisfaction with the depth of the doctor - patient relationship was increased with the agenda form . The occurrence of " by the way " presentations did not change . A patient completed agenda form before the consultation or general practitioner education about the agenda form , or both , enabled the identification of more problems in consultations even though consultations were longer .
