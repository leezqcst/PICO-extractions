Effect of beta radiation on success of glaucoma drainage surgery in South Africa : randomised controlled trial . To evaluate whether beta radiation may offer a practical method of improving surgical success for glaucoma drainage surgery in South Africa . Double blind , randomised controlled trial . 3 public hospitals in South Africa . 450 black Africans with primary glaucoma . Trabeculectomy with 1000 cGy beta radiation or standard trabeculectomy without beta radiation ( placebo ) . Primary outcome measure was surgical failure within 12 months ( intraocular pressure > 21 mm Hg while receiving no treatment for ocular hypotension ) . Secondary outcomes were visual acuity , surgical reintervention for cataract , and intraoperative and postoperative complications . 320 people were recruited . beta radiation was given to 164 ; 20 ( 6 % ) were not seen again after surgery . 1 year after surgery the estimated risk of surgical failure was 30 % ( 95 % confidence interval 22 % to 38 % ) in the placebo arm compared with 5 % ( 2 % to 10 % ) in the radiation arm . The radiation group experienced a higher incidence of operable cataract ( 18 participants ) than the placebo group ( 5 participants ; P = 0.01 ) . At 2 years the estimated risks with placebo and beta radiation were , respectively , 2.8 % ( 0.9 % to 8.3 % ) and 16.7 % ( 10.0 % to 27.3 % ) . beta radiation substantially reduced the risk of surgical failure after glaucoma surgery . Some evidence was , however , found of an increased risk for cataract surgery ( a known complication of trabeculectomy ) in the beta radiation arm during the 2 years after surgery .
