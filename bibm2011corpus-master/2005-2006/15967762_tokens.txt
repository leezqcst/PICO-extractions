Should treatment of ( sub ) acute low back pain be aimed at psychosocial prognostic factors ? Cluster randomised clinical trial in general practice . To compare the effects of a minimal intervention strategy aimed at assessment and modification of psychosocial prognostic factors and usual care for treatment of ( sub ) acute low back pain in general practice . Cluster randomised clinical trial . 60 general practitioners in 41 general practices . 314 patients with non - specific low back pain of less than 12 weeks ' duration , recruited by their general practitioner . In the minimal intervention strategy group the general practitioner explored the presence of psychosocial prognostic factors , discussed these factors , set specific goals for reactivation , and provided an educational booklet . The consultation took about 20 minutes . Usual care was not standardised . Functional disability ( Roland-Morris disability questionnaire ) , perceived recovery , and sick leave because of low back pain assessed at baseline and after 6 , 13 , 26 , and 52 weeks . The dropout rate was 8 % in the minimal intervention strategy group and 9 % in the usual care group . Multilevel analyses showed no significant differences between the groups on any outcome measure during 12 months of follow - up in the whole group or in relevant subgroups ( patients with high scores on psychosocial measures at baseline or a history of frequent or prolonged low back pain ) . This study provides no evidence that ( Dutch ) general practitioners should adopt our new treatment strategy aimed at psychosocial prognostic factors in patients with ( sub ) acute low back pain . Further research should examine why our new strategy was not more effective than usual care .
