Effect of perioperative beta blockade in patients with diabetes undergoing major non - cardiac surgery : randomised placebo controlled , blinded multicentre trial . To evaluate the long term effects of perioperative beta blockade on mortality and cardiac morbidity in patients with diabetes undergoing major non - cardiac surgery . Randomised placebo controlled and blinded multicentre trial . Analyses were by intention to treat . University anaesthesia and surgical centres and 1 coordinating centre . 921 patients aged > 39 scheduled for major non - cardiac surgery . 100 mg metoprolol controlled and extended release or placebo administered from the day before surgery to a maximum of 8 perioperative days . The composite primary outcome measure was time to all cause mortality , acute myocardial infarction , unstable angina , or congestive heart failure . Secondary outcome measures were time to all cause mortality , cardiac mortality , and non - fatal cardiac morbidity . Mean duration of intervention was 4.6 days in the metoprolol group and 4.9 days in the placebo group . Metoprolol significantly reduced the mean heart rate by 11 % ( 95 % confidence interval 9 % to 13 % ) and mean blood pressure by 3 % ( 1 % to 5 % ) . The primary outcome occurred in 99 of 462 patients in the metoprolol group ( 21 % ) and 93 of 459 patients in the placebo group ( 20 % ) ( hazard ratio 1.06 , 0.80 to 1.41 ) during a median follow - up of 18 months ( range 6-30 ) . All cause mortality was 16 % ( 74 / 462 ) in the metoprolol group and 16 % ( 72 / 459 ) in the placebo group ( 1.03 , 0.74 to 1.42 ) . The difference in risk for the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was 2.4 % ( - 0.8 % to 5.6 % ) . Perioperative metoprolol did not significantly affect mortality and cardiac morbidity in these patients with diabetes . Confidence intervals , however , were wide , and the issue needs reassessment .
