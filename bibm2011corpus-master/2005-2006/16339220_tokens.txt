Randomised placebo controlled multicentre trial to assess short term clarithromycin for patients with stable coronary heart disease : CLARICOR trial . To determine if the macrolide clarithromycin affects mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with stable coronary heart disease . Centrally randomised multicentre trial . All parties at all stages were blinded . Analyses were by intention to treat . 5 Copenhagen University cardiology departments and a coordinating centre . 13 , 702 patients aged 18 to 85 years who had a discharge diagnosis of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris in 1993 -9 and alive in August 1999 were invited by letter ; 4373 were randomised . 2 weeks ' treatment with clarithromycin 500 mg / day or matching placebo . Primary outcome : composite of all cause mortality , myocardial infarction , or unstable angina pectoris during 3 years ' follow - up . Secondary outcome : composite of cardiovascular mortality , myocardial infarction , or unstable angina pectoris . The outcomes were obtained from Danish registers and were blindly assessed by the event committee . 2172 participants were randomised to clarithromycin and 2201 to placebo . We found no significant effects of clarithromycin on the primary outcome ( hazard ratio 1.15 , 95 % confidence interval 0.99 to 1.34 ) or secondary outcome ( 1.17 , 0.98 to 1.40 ) . Mortality was significantly higher in the clarithromycin arm ( 1.27 , 1.03 to 1.54 ; P = 0.03 ) as a result of significantly higher cardiovascular mortality ( 1.45 , 1.09 to 1.92 ; P = 0.01 ) . Short term clarithromycin in patients with stable coronary heart disease may cause significantly higher cardiovascular mortality . The long term safety of clarithromycin in patients with stable ischaemic heart disease should be examined . Trial registration ClinicalTrials .gov NCT00121550 .
