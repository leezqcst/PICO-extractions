Efficacy and safety of fondaparinux for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in older acute medical patients : randomised placebo controlled trial . To determine the efficacy and safety of the anticoagulant fondaparinux in older acute medical inpatients at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism . Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial . 35 centres in 8 countries . 849 medical patients aged 60 or more admitted to hospital for congestive heart failure , acute respiratory illness in the presence of chronic lung disease , or acute infectious or inflammatory disease and expected to remain in bed for at least 4 days . 2.5 mg fondaparinux or placebo subcutaneously once daily for 6 to 14 days . The primary efficacy outcome was venous thromboembolism detected by routine bilateral venography along with symptomatic venous thromboembolism up to day 15 . Secondary outcomes were bleeding and death . Patients were followed up at 1 month . 425 patients in the fondaparinux group and 414 patients in the placebo group were evaluable for safety analysis ( 10 were not treated ) . 644 patients ( 75.9 % ) were available for the primary efficacy analysis . Venous thrombembolism was detected in 5.6 % ( 18 / 321 ) of patients treated with fondaparinux and 10.5 % ( 34 / 323 ) of patients given placebo , a relative risk reduction of 46.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval 7.7 % to 69.3 % ) . Symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 5 patients in the placebo group and none in the fondaparinux group ( P = 0.029 ) . Major bleeding occurred in 1 patient ( 0.2 % ) in each group . At the end of follow - up , 14 patients in the fondaparinux group ( 3.3 % ) and 25 in the placebo group ( 6.0 % ) had died . Fondaparinux is effective in the prevention of asymptomatic and symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in older acute medical patients . The frequency of major bleeding was similar for both fondaparinux and placebo treated patients .
