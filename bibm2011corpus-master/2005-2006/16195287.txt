Effect of sublingual misoprostol on severe postpartum haemorrhage in a primary health centre in Guinea-Bissau : randomised double blind clinical trial . To evaluate whether routine administration of sublingual misoprostol 600 microg after delivery reduces postpartum haemorrhage . Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial . Primary health centre in Bissau , Guinea-Bissau , West Africa . 661 women undergoing vaginal delivery . Misoprostol 600 mug or placebo administered sublingually immediately after delivery . Postpartum haemorrhage , defined as a loss of > or = 500 ml and decrease in haemoglobin concentration after delivery . The incidence of postpartum haemorrhage was not significantly different between the 2 groups , the relative risk being 0.89 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.76 to 1.04 ) in the misoprostol group compared with the placebo group . Mean blood loss was 10.5 % ( - 0.5 % to 20.4 % ) lower in the misoprostol group than in the control group . Severe postpartum haemorrhage of > or = 1000 ml or > or = 1500 ml occurred in 17 % ( 56 ) and 8 % ( 25 ) in the placebo group and 11 % ( 37 ) and 2 % ( 7 ) in the misoprostol group . Significantly fewer women in the misoprostol group experienced a loss of > or = 1000 ml ( 0.66 , 0.45 to 0.98 ) or > or = 1500 ml ( 0.28 , 0.12 to 0.64 ) . The decrease in haemoglobin concentration tended to be less in the misoprostol group , the mean difference between the 2 groups being 0.16 mmol / l ( - 0.01 mmol / l to 0.32 mmol / l ) . Sublingual misoprostol reduces the frequency of severe postpartum haemorrhage .
