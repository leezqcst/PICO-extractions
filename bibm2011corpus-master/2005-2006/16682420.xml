  <fulltext>HIV prevention in Mexican schools : prospective randomised evaluation of intervention . To assess effects on condom use and other sexual behaviour of an HIV prevention programme at school that promotes the use of condoms with and without emergency contraception . Cluster randomised controlled trial . 40 public high schools in the state of Morelos , Mexico . 10 954 first year high school students . Schools were randomised to 1 of 3 arms : an HIV prevention course that promoted condom use , the same course with emergency contraception as back - up , or the existing sex education course . Self administered anonymous questionnaires were completed at baseline , 4 months , and 16 months . Students at intervention schools received a 30 hour course ( over 15 weeks ) on HIV prevention and life skills , designed in accordance with guidelines of the joint United Nations programme on HIV / AIDS . 2 extra hours of education on emergency contraception were given to students in the condom promotion with contraception arm . Primary outcome measure was reported condom use . Other outcomes were reported sexual activity ; knowledge and attitudes about HIV and emergency contraception ; and attitudes and confidence about condom use . Intervention did not affect reported condom use . Knowledge of HIV improved in both intervention arms and knowledge of emergency contraception improved in the condom promotion with contraception arm . Reported sexual behaviour was similar in the intervention arms and the control group . A rigorously designed , implemented , and evaluated HIV education course based in public high schools did not reduce risk behaviour , so such courses need to be redesigned and evaluated . Addition of emergency contraception did not decrease reported condom use or increase risky sexual behaviour but did increase reported use of emergency contraception .</fulltext>
