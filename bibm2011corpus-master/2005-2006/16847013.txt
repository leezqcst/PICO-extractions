A randomised controlled trial of management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis in general practice . To assess different management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis . Open , factorial , randomised controlled trial . 30 general practices in southern England . 307 adults and children with acute infective conjunctivitis . 1 of 3 antibiotic prescribing strategies - immediate antibiotics ( chloramphenicol eye drops ; n = 104 ) , no antibiotics ( controls ; n = 94 ) , or delayed antibiotics ( n = 109 ) ; a patient information leaflet or not ; and an eye swab or not . Severity of symptoms on days 1-3 after consultation , duration of symptoms , and belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics for eye infections . Prescribing strategies did not affect the severity of symptoms but duration of moderate symptoms was less with antibiotics : no antibiotics ( controls ) 4.8 days , immediate antibiotics 3.3 days ( risk ratio 0.7 , 95 % confidence interval 0.6 to 0.8 ) , delayed antibiotics 3.9 days ( 0.8 , 0.7 to 0.9 ) . Compared with no initial offer of antibiotics , antibiotic use was higher in the immediate antibiotic group : controls 30 % , immediate antibiotics 99 % ( odds ratio 185.4 , 23.9 to 1439.2 ) , delayed antibiotics 53 % ( 2.9 , 1.4 to 5.7 ) , as was belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics : controls 47 % , immediate antibiotics 67 % ( odds ratio 2.4 , 1.1 to 5.0 ) , delayed antibiotics 55 % ( 1.4 , 0.7 to 3.0 ) , and intention to reattend for eye infections : controls 40 % , immediate antibiotics 68 % ( 3.2 , 1.6 to 6.4 ) , delayed antibiotics 41 % ( 1.0 , 0.5 to 2.0 ) . A patient information leaflet or eye swab had no effect on the main outcomes . Reattendance within 2 weeks was less in the delayed compared with immediate antibiotic group : 0.3 ( 0.1 to 1.0 ) v 0.7 ( 0.3 to 1.6 ) . Delayed prescribing of antibiotics is probably the most appropriate strategy for managing acute conjunctivitis in primary care . It reduces antibiotic use , shows no evidence of medicalisation , provides similar duration and severity of symptoms to immediate prescribing , and reduces reattendance for eye infections .
