Long term outcomes from the IMPACT randomised trial for depressed elderly patients in primary care . To determine the long term effectiveness of collaborative care management for depression in late life . 2 arm , randomised , clinical trial ; intervention 1 year and follow - up 2 years . 18 primary care clinics in 8 US healthcare organisations . Patients 1801 primary care patients aged 60 and older with major depression , dysthymia , or both . Patients were randomly assigned to a 12 month collaborative care intervention ( IMPACT ) or usual care for depression . Teams including a depression care manager , primary care doctor , and psychiatrist offered education , behavioural activation , antidepressants , a brief , behaviour based psychotherapy ( problem solving treatment ) , and relapse prevention geared to each patient 's needs and preferences . Interviewers , blinded to treatment assignment , conducted interviews in person at baseline and by telephone at each subsequent follow up . They measured depression ( SCL-20 ) , overall functional impairment and quality of life ( SF-12 ) , physical functioning ( PCS-12 ) , depression treatment , and satisfaction with care . IMPACT patients fared significantly ( P < 0.05 ) better than controls regarding continuation of antidepressant treatment , depressive symptoms , remission of depression , physical functioning , quality of life , self efficacy , and satisfaction with care at 18 and 24 months . 1 year after IMPACT resources were withdrawn , a significant difference in SCL-20 scores ( 0.23 , P < 0.0001 ) favouring IMPACT patients remained . Tailored collaborative care actively engages older adults in treatment for depression and delivers substantial and persistent long term benefits . Benefits include less depression , better physical functioning , and an enhanced quality of life . The IMPACT model may show the way to less depression and healthier lives for older adults .
