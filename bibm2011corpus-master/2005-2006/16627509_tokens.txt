Age related , structured educational programmes for the management of atopic dermatitis in children and adolescents : multicentre , randomised controlled trial . To determine the effects of age related , structured educational programmes on the management of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in childhood and adolescence . Multicentre , randomised controlled trial . 7 hospitals in Germany . Parents of children with atopic dermatitis aged 3 months to 7 years ( n = 274 ) and 8-12 years ( n = 102 ) , adolescents with atopic dermatitis aged 13-18 years ( n = 70 ) , and controls ( n = 244 , n = 83 , and n = 50 , respectively ) . Group sessions of standardised intervention programmes for atopic dermatitis once weekly for 6 weeks or no education ( control group ) . Severity of eczema ( scoring of atopic dermatitis scale ) , subjective severity ( standardised questionnaires ) , and quality of life for parents of affected children aged less than 13 years , over 12 months . Significant improvements in severity of eczema and subjective severity were seen in all intervention groups compared with control groups ( total score for severity : age 3 months to 7 years - 17.5 , 95 % confidence intervals - 19.6 to - 15.3 v - 12.2 , - 14.3 to - 10.1 ; age 8-12 years - 16.0 , - 20.0 to - 12.0 v - 7.8 , - 11.4 ; - 4.3 ; and age 13-18 years - 19.7 , - 23.7 to - 15.7 v - 5.2 , - 10.5 to 0.1 ) . Parents of affected children aged less than 7 years experienced significantly better improvement in all 5 quality of life subscales , whereas parents of affected children aged 8-12 years experienced significantly better improvement in 3 of 5 quality of life subscales . Age related educational programmes for the control of atopic dermatitis in children and adolescents are effective in the long term management of the disease .
