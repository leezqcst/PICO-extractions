Randomised controlled trial of the Lidcombe programme of early stuttering intervention . To evaluate the efficacy of the Lidcombe programme of early stuttering intervention by comparison to a control group . A pragmatic , open plan , parallel group , randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment . 2 public speech clinics in New Zealand . Stuttering preschool children who presented to the speech clinics for treatment . Inclusion criteria were age 3-6 years and frequency of stuttering of at least 2 % syllables stuttered . Exclusion criteria were onset of stuttering during the 6 months before recruitment and treatment for stuttering during the previous 12 months . 54 participants were randomised : 29 to the Lidcombe programme arm and 25 to the control arm . 12 of the participants were girls . Lidcombe programme of early stuttering intervention . Frequency of stuttering was measured as the proportion of syllables stuttered , from audiotaped recordings of participants ' conversational speech outside the clinic . Parents in both arms of the trial collected speech samples in 3 different speaking situations before randomisation and at 3 , 6 , and 9 months after randomisation . Analysis showed a highly significant difference ( P = 0.003 ) at 9 months after randomisation . The mean proportion of syllables stuttered at 9 months after randomisation was 1.5 % ( SD 1.4 ) for the treatment arm and 3.9 % ( SD 3.5 ) for the control arm , giving an effect size of 2.3 % of syllables stuttered ( 95 % confidence interval 0.8 to 3.9 ) . This effect size was more than double the minimum clinically worthwhile difference specified in the trial protocol . The results provide evidence from a randomised controlled trial to support early intervention for stuttering . The Lidcombe programme is an efficacious treatment for stuttering in children of preschool age .
