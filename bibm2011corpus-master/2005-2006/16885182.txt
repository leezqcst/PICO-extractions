Safety and efficacy of routine postoperative ibuprofen for pain and disability related to ectopic bone formation after hip replacement surgery ( HIPAID ) : randomised controlled trial . To determine the benefits and risks of a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) as prophylaxis for ectopic bone formation in patients undergoing total hip replacement ( or revision ) surgery . Double blind randomised placebo controlled clinical trial , stratified by treatment site and surgery ( primary or revision ) . 20 orthopaedic surgery centres in Australia and New Zealand . 902 patients undergoing elective primary or revision total hip replacement surgery . 14 days ' treatment with ibuprofen ( 1200 mg daily ) or matching placebo started within 24 hours of surgery . Changes in self reported hip pain and physical function 6 to 12 months after surgery ( Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis index ) . There were no significant differences between the groups for improvements in hip pain ( mean difference - 0.1 , 95 % confidence interval - 0.4 to 0.2 , P = 0.6 ) or physical function ( - 0.1 , - 0.4 to 0.2 , P = 0.5 ) , despite a decreased risk of ectopic bone formation ( relative risk 0.69 , 0.56 to 0.83 ) associated with ibuprofen . There was a significantly increased risk of major bleeding complications n the ibuprofen group during the admission period ( 2.09 , 1.00 to 4.39 ) . These data do not support the use of routine prophylaxis with NSAIDs in patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery . NCT00145730 .
