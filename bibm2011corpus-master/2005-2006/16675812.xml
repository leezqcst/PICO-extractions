  <fulltext>Safety and efficacy of rectal compared with intramuscular quinine for the early treatment of moderately severe malaria in children : randomised clinical trial . To compare the safety and efficacy of quinine given by the rectal route with quinine given by the intramuscular route in children with moderately severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria . Randomised , open , clinical trial . Health centre in Burkina Faso . 898 children with moderately severe P falciparum malaria who were unable to take oral treatment . Rectal quinine ( 20 mg / kg diluted to 30 mg / ml in water solution ) or intramuscular quinine ( 12.5 mg / kg ) every 12 hours until oral quinine could be taken . Primary safety outcome was the presence of blood in stools and secondary safety outcome was diarrhoea . Primary efficacy outcome was early treatment failure and secondary efficacy outcomes were late clinical and parasitological failures , fever clearance time , and time to oral intake . Blood in stools and diarrhoea were more common in children given quinine by the rectal route than by the intramuscular route ( blood in stools : 5 % v 1 % , absolute difference 3.9 % , 95 % confidence interval 1.8 % to 6.1 % ; diarrhoea : 5 % v 1 % , 3.5 % , 1.3 % to 5.7 % ) . On anoscopy , inflammatory lesions ( 9 / 248 , 3 % ) were associated with bloody striations in stools . Side effects of rectal quinine were rare and transitory . Local pain ( 90 % ) , inflammation ( 79 % ) , and transient impairment of mobility ( 15 % ) were observed with intramuscular quinine . Early treatment failure was higher in the rectal group ( 6 % v 3 % , absolute difference 3.0 % , 95 % confidence interval 0.2 % to 5.9 % ) . All except 2 children in each group had negative blood slide results at day 5 . Fever recurrence at day 7 was higher in the intramuscular group ( 37 / 375 v 18 / 395 , absolute difference 5.3 % , 1.6 % to 8.9 % ) . Other efficacy outcomes ( late clinical failure , late parasitological failure , fever clearance time , time to starting oral intake and rate of deterioration to severe malaria ) did not differ . Quinine given by the rectal route has an acceptable safety profile and could be used in the early management of moderately severe malaria in children in sub- Saharan Africa , halting progression to severe disease .</fulltext>
