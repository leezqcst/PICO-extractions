Mobilisation with movement and exercise , corticosteroid injection , or wait and see for tennis elbow : randomised trial . To investigate the efficacy of physiotherapy compared with a wait and see approach or corticosteroid injections over 52 weeks in tennis elbow . Single blind randomised controlled trial . Community setting , Brisbane , Australia . 198 participants aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum 6 weeks ' duration , who had not received any other active treatment by a health practitioner in the previous 6 months . 8 sessions of physiotherapy ; corticosteroid injections ; or wait and see . Global improvement , grip force , and assessor 's rating of severity measured at baseline , 6 weeks , and 52 weeks . Corticosteroid injection showed significantly better effects at 6 weeks but with high recurrence rates thereafter ( 47 / 65 of successes subsequently regressed ) and significantly poorer outcomes in the long term compared with physiotherapy . Physiotherapy was superior to wait and see in the short term ; no difference was seen at 52 weeks , when most participants in both groups reported a successful outcome . Participants who had physiotherapy sought less additional treatment , such as non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , than did participants who had wait and see or injections . Physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and exercise has a superior benefit to wait and see in the first 6 weeks and to corticosteroid injections after 6 weeks , providing a reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term . The significant short term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after 6 weeks , with high recurrence rates , implying that this treatment should be used with caution in the management of tennis elbow .
