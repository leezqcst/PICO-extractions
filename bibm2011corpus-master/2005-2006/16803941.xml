  <fulltext>Improving women 's experience during speculum examinations at routine gynaecological visits : randomised clinical trial . To determine if a standardised method of leg positioning without stirrups reduces the physical discomfort and sense of vulnerability and increases the sense of control among women undergoing speculum examination as part of a routine gynaecological examination . Randomised clinical trial . Family medicine outpatient clinic . 197 adult women undergoing routine gynaecological examination and cervical smear . Examination with or without stirrups . Women 's perceived levels of physical discomfort , sense of vulnerability , and sense of control during the examination , measured on 100 mm visual analogue scales . Women undergoing examination without stirrups had a reduction in mean sense of vulnerability from 23.6 to 13.1 ( 95 % confidence interval of the difference - 16.6 to - 4.4 ) . Mean physical discomfort was reduced from 30.4 to 17.2 ( - 19.7 to - 6.8 ) . There was no significant reduction in sense of loss of control . Women should be able to have gynaecological examinations without using stirrups to reduce the stress associated with speculum examinations . US Army Central Investigation Regulatory Office .
