Antioxidant supplementation for the prevention of kwashiorkor in Malawian children : randomised , double blind , placebo controlled trial . To evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in preventing kwashiorkor in a population of Malawian children at high risk of developing kwashiorkor . Prospective , double blind , placebo controlled trial randomised by household . 8 villages in rural southern Malawi . 2372 children in 2156 households aged 1-4 years were enrolled ; 2332 completed the trial . Daily supplementation with an antioxidant powder containing riboflavin , vitamin E , selenium , and N-acetylcysteine in a dose that provided about 3 times the recommended dietary allowance of each nutrient or placebo for 20 weeks . The primary outcome was the incidence of oedema . Secondary outcomes were the rates of change for weight and length and the number of days of infectious symptoms . 62 children developed kwashiorkor ( defined by the presence of oedema ) ; 39 / 1184 ( 3.3 % ) were in the antioxidant group and 23 / 1188 ( 1.9 % ) were in the placebo group ( relative risk 1.70 , 95 % confidence interval 0.98 to 2.42 ) . The 2 groups did not differ in rates of weight or height gain . Children who received antioxidant supplementation did not experience less fever , cough , or diarrhoea . Antioxidant supplementation at the dose provided did not prevent the onset of kwashiorkor . This finding does not support the hypothesis that depletion of vitamin E , selenium , cysteine , or riboflavin has a role in the development of kwashiorkor .
