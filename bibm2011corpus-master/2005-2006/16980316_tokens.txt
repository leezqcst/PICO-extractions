Randomised controlled trial of a short course of traditional acupuncture compared with usual care for persistent non - specific low back pain . To determine whether a short course of traditional acupuncture improves longer term outcomes for patients with persistent non - specific low back pain in primary care . Pragmatic , open , randomised controlled trial . 3 private acupuncture clinics and 18 general practices in York , England . 241 adults aged 18 - 65 with non - specific low back pain of 4-52 weeks ' duration . 10 individualised acupuncture treatments from 1 of 6 qualified acupuncturists ( 160 patients ) or usual care only ( 81 patients ) . The primary outcome was SF-36 bodily pain , measured at 12 and 24 months . Other outcomes included reported use of analgesics , scores on the Oswestry pain disability index , safety , and patient satisfaction . 39 general practitioners referred 289 patients of whom 241 were randomised . At 12 months average SF-36 pain scores increased by 33.2 to 64.0 in the acupuncture group and by 27.9 to 58.3 in the control group . Adjusting for baseline score and for any clustering by acupuncturist , the estimated intervention effect was 5.6 points ( 95 % confidence interval - 0.2 to 11.4 ) at 12 months ( n = 213 ) and 8.0 points ( 2.8 to 13.2 ) at 24 months ( n = 182 ) . The magnitude of the difference between the groups was about 10 % - 15 % of the final pain score in the control group . Functional disability was not improved . No serious or life threatening events were reported . Weak evidence was found of an effect of acupuncture on persistent non - specific low back pain at 12 months , but stronger evidence of a small benefit at 24 months . Referral to a qualified traditional acupuncturist for a short course of treatment seems safe and acceptable to patients with low back pain . ISRCTN80764175 [ controlled - trials .com ] .
