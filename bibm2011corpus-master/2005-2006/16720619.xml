  <fulltext>Randomised controlled trial of 4 commercial weight loss programmes in the UK : initial findings from the BBC " diet trials " . To compare the effectiveness of 4 commercial weight loss diets available to adults in the United Kingdom . 6 month multicentre randomised unblinded controlled trial . Community based sample of otherwise healthy overweight and obese adults . Dr Atkins ' new diet revolution , Slim-Fast plan , Weight Watchers pure points programme , and Rosemary Conley 's eat yourself slim diet and fitness plan . Weight and body fat changes over 6 months . All diets resulted in significant loss of body fat and weight over 6 months . Groups did not differ significantly but loss of body fat and weight was greater in all groups compared with the control group . In an intention to treat analysis , average weight loss was 5.9 kg and average fat loss was 4.4 kg over 6 months . The Atkins diet resulted in significantly higher weight loss during the first 4 weeks , but by the end was no more or less effective than the other diets . Clinically useful weight loss and fat loss can be achieved in adults who are motivated to follow commercial diets for a substantial period . Given the limited resources for weight management in the NHS , healthcare practitioners should discuss with their patients programmes known to be effective . Clinical trials NCT00327821 .</fulltext>
