Immediate computed tomography or admission for observation after mild head injury : cost comparison in randomised controlled trial . To compare the costs of immediate computed tomography during triage for admission with those of observation in hospital in patients with mild head injury . Prospective cost effectiveness analysis within a multicentre , pragmatic randomised trial . 39 acute hospitals in Sweden PARTICIPANTS : 2602 patients ( aged > or = 6 ) with mild head injury . Immediate computed tomography or admission for observation . Direct and indirect costs related to the mild head injury during the acute and 3 month follow - up period . Outcome after 3 months was similar for both strategies ( non - significantly in favour of computed tomography ) . For the acute stage and complications , the cost was 461 euros ( 314 pounds sterling , 582 dollars ) per patient in the computed tomography group and 677 euros ( 462 pounds sterling , 854 dollars ) in the observation group ; an average of 32 % less in the computed tomography group ( 216 euros , 95 % confidence interval - 272 to - 164 ; P < 0.001 ) . Sensitivity analysis showed that computed tomography was the most cost effective strategy under a broad range of assumptions . After 3 months , total costs were 718 euros and 914 euros per patient - that is , 196 euros less in the computed tomography group ( - 281 to - 114 ; P < 0.001 ) . The lower cost of the computed tomography strategy at the acute stage thus remained unchanged during follow - up . Patients with mild head injury attending an emergency department can be managed more cost effectively with computed tomography rather than admission for observation in hospital . ISRCTN81464462 .
