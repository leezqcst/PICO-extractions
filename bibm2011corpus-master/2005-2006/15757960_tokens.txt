Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms : single centre randomised controlled trial . To determine whether screening Danish men aged 65 or more for abdominal aortic aneurysms reduces mortality . Single centre randomised controlled trial . All 5 hospitals in Viborg County , Denmark . All 12 , 639 men born during 1921-33 and living in Viborg County . In 1994 we included men born 1921-9 ( 64-73 years ) . We also included men who became 65 during 1995 -8 . Men were randomised to the intervention group ( screening by abdominal ultrasonography ) or control group . Participants with an abdominal aortic aneurysm > 5 cm were referred for surgical evaluation , and those with smaller aneurysms were offered annual scans . Specific mortality due to abdominal aortic aneurysm , overall mortality , and number of planned and emergency operations for abdominal aortic aneurysms . 4860 of 6333 men were screened ( attendance rate 76.6 % ) . 191 ( 4.0 % of those screened ) had abdominal aortic aneurysms . The mean follow - up time was 52 months . The screened group underwent 75 % ( 95 % confidence interval 51 % to 91 % ) fewer emergency operations than the control group . Deaths due to abdominal aortic aneurysms occurred in 9 patients in the screened group and 27 in the control group . The number needed to screen to save 1 life was 352 . Specific mortality was significantly reduced by 67 % ( 29 % to 84 % ) . Mortality due to non - abdominal aortic aneurysms was non - significantly reduced by 8 % . The benefits of screening may increase with time . Mass screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in Danish men aged 65 or more reduces mortality .
