Randomised trial of telephone intervention in chronic heart failure : DIAL trial . To determine whether a centralised telephone intervention reduces the incidence of death or admission for worsening heart failure in outpatients with chronic heart failure . Multicentre randomised controlled trial . 51 centres in Argentina ( public and private hospitals and ambulatory settings ) . 1518 outpatients with stable chronic heart failure and optimal drug treatment randomised , stratified by attending cardiologist , to telephone intervention or usual care . Education , counselling , and monitoring by nurses through frequent telephone follow - up in addition to usual care , delivered from a single centre . All cause mortality or admission to hospital for worsening heart failure . Complete follow - up was available in 99.5 % of patients . The 758 patients in the usual care group were more likely to be admitted for worsening heart failure or to die ( 235 events , 31 % ) than the 760 patients who received the telephone intervention ( 200 events , 26.3 % ) ( relative risk reduction = 20 % , 95 % confidence interval 3 to 34 , P = 0.026 ) . This benefit was mostly due to a significant reduction in admissions for heart failure ( relative risk reduction = 29 % , P = 0.005 ) . Mortality was similar in both groups . At the end of the study the intervention group had a better quality of life than the usual care group ( mean total score on Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire 30.6 v 35 , P = 0.001 ) . This simple , centralised heart failure programme was effective in reducing the primary end point through a significant reduction in admissions to hospital for heart failure .
