  <fulltext>Effect of family style mealtimes on quality of life , physical performance , and body weight of nursing home residents : cluster randomised controlled trial . To assess the effect of family style mealtimes on quality of life , physical performance , and body weight of nursing home residents without dementia . Cluster randomised trial . 5 Dutch nursing homes . 178 residents ( mean age 77 years ) . 2 wards in each home were randomised to intervention ( 95 participants ) or control groups ( 83 ) . During 6 months the intervention group took their meals family style and the control group received the usual individual pre - plated service . Quality of life ( perceived safety ; autonomy ; and sensory , physical , and psychosocial functioning ) , gross and fine motor function , and body weight . The difference in change between the groups was significant for overall quality of life ( 6.1 units , 95 % confidence interval 2.1 to 10.3 ) , fine motor function ( 1.8 units , 0.6 to 3.0 ) , and body weight ( 1.5 kg , 0.6 to 2.4 ) .
