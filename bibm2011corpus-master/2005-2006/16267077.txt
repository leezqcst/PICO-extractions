Transitional care facility for elderly people in hospital awaiting a long term care bed : randomised controlled trial . To assess the effectiveness of moving patients who are waiting in hospital for a long term care bed to an off - site transitional care facility . Randomised controlled trial . 3 public hospitals in Southern Adelaide . 320 elderly patients ( mean age 83 years ) in acute hospital beds ( 212 randomised to intervention , 108 to control ) . A transitional care facility where all patients received a single assessment from a specialist elder care team and appropriate ongoing therapy . Length of stay in hospital , rates of readmission , deaths , and patient 's functional level ( modified Barthel index ) , quality of life ( assessment of quality of life ) , and care needs ( residential care scale ) at 4 months . From admission , those in the intervention group stayed a median of 32.5 days ( 95 % confidence interval 29 to 36 days ) in hospital . In the control group the median length of stay was 43.5 days ( 41 to 51 days ) ( 95 % confidence interval for difference 6 to 16 days ) . Patients in the intervention group took a median of 21 days ( 6 to 27 days ) longer to be admitted to permanent care than those in the control group . In both groups few patients went home ( 14 ( 7 % ) in the intervention group v 9 ( 9 % ) in the control group ) . There were no significant differences in death rates ( 28 % v 27 % ) or rates of transfer back to hospital ( 28 % v 25 % ) . For frail elderly patients who are awaiting a residential care bed transfer out of hospital to an off - site transitional care unit with focus on aged care " unblocks beds " without adverse effects .
