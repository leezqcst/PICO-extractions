Effect of educational outreach to nurses on tuberculosis case detection and primary care of respiratory illness : pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial . To develop and implement an educational outreach programme for the integrated case management of priority respiratory diseases ( practical approach to lung health in South Africa ; PALSA ) and to evaluate its effects on respiratory care and detection of tuberculosis among adults attending primary care clinics . Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial , with clinics as the unit of randomisation . 40 primary care clinics , staffed by nurse practitioners , in the Free State province , South Africa . 1999 patients aged 15 or over with cough or difficult breathing ( 1000 in intervention clinics , 999 in control clinics ) . Between 2 and 6 educational outreach sessions delivered to nurse practitioners by usual trainers from the health department . The emphasis was on key messages drawn from the customised clinical practice guideline for the outreach programme , with illustrative support materials . Sputum screening for tuberculosis , tuberculosis case detection , inhaled corticosteroid prescriptions for obstructive lung disease , and antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections . All clinics and almost all patients ( 92.8 % , 1856 / 1999 ) completed the trial . Although sputum testing for tuberculosis was similar between the groups ( 22.6 % in outreach group v 19.3 % in control group ; odds ratio 1.22 , 95 % confidence interval 0.83 to 1.80 ) , the case detection of tuberculosis was higher in the outreach group ( 6.4 % v 3.8 % ; 1.72 , 1.04 to 2.85 ) . Prescriptions for inhaled corticosteroids were also higher ( 13.7 % v 7.7 % ; 1.90 , 1.14 to 3.18 ) but the number of antibiotic prescriptions was similar ( 39.7 % v 39.4 % ; 1.01 , 0.74 to 1.38 ) . Combining educational outreach with integrated case management provides a promising model for improving quality of care and control of priority respiratory diseases , without extra staff , in resource poor settings .
