  <fulltext>Can sutures get wet ? Prospective randomised controlled trial of wound management in general practice . To compare standard management of keeping wounds dry and covered with allowing wounds to be uncovered and wet in the first 48 hours after minor skin excision . Prospective , randomised controlled , multicentre trial testing for equivalence of infection rates . Primary care in regional centre , Queensland , Australia . 857 patients randomised to either keep their wound dry and covered ( n = 442 ) or remove the dressing and wet the wound ( n = 415 ) . The incidence of infection in the intervention group ( 8.4 % ) was not inferior to the incidence in the control group ( 8.9 % ) ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . The 1 sided 95 % confidence interval for the difference of infection rates was infinity to 0.028 . These results indicate that wounds can be uncovered and allowed to get wet in the first 48 hours after minor skin excision without increasing the incidence of infection .</fulltext>
