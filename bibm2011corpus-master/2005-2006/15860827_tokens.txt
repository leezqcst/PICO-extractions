Randomised controlled trial of calcium and supplementation with cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) for prevention of fractures in primary care . To assess whether supplementation with calcium and cholecaliferol ( vitamin D3 ) reduces the risk of fracture in women with 1 or more risk factors for fracture of the hip . Pragmatic open randomised controlled trial . Practice nurse led clinics in primary care . 3314 women aged 70 and over with 1 or more risk factors for hip fracture : any previous fracture , low body weight ( < 58 kg ) , smoker , family history of hip fracture , or fair or poor self reported health . Daily oral supplementation using 1000 mg calcium with 800 IU cholecaliferol and information leaflet on dietary calcium intake and prevention of falls , or leaflet only ( control group ) . Primary outcome measure was all clinical fractures and secondary outcome measures were adherence to treatment , falls , and quality of life ( measured with the SF-12 ) . 69 % of the women who completed the follow - up questionnaire at 24 months were still taking supplements ( 55 % with inclusion of randomised participants known to be alive ) . After a median follow - up of 25 months ( range 18 to 42 months ) , clinical fracture rates were lower than expected in both groups but did not significantly differ for all clinical fractures ( odds ratio for fracture in supplemented group 1.01 , 95 % confidence interval 0.71 to 1.43 ) . The odds ratio for hip fracture was 0.75 ( 0.31 to 1.78 ) . The odds of a woman having a fall at 6 and 12 months was 0.99 and 0.98 , respectively . Quality of life did not significantly differ between the groups . We found no evidence that calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of clinical fractures in women with 1 or more risk factors for hip fracture .
