Impact of Helicobacter pylori eradication on dyspepsia , health resource use , and quality of life in the Bristol helicobacter project : randomised controlled trial . To determine the impact of a community based Helicobacter pylori screening and eradication programme on the incidence of dyspepsia , resource use , and quality of life , including a cost consequences analysis . H pylori screening programme followed by randomised placebo controlled trial of eradication . 7 general practices in southwest England . 10,537 unselected people aged 20-59 years were screened for H pylori infection ( 13C urea breath test ) ; 1558 of the 1636 participants who tested positive were randomised to H pylori eradication treatment or placebo , and 1539 ( 99 % ) were followed up for 2 years . Ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks or placebo . Primary care consultation rates for dyspepsia ( defined as epigastric pain ) 2 years after randomisation , with secondary outcomes of dyspepsia symptoms , resource use , NHS costs , and quality of life . In the eradication group , 35 % fewer participants consulted for dyspepsia over 2 years compared with the placebo group ( 55 / 787 v 78 / 771 ; odds ratio 0.65 , 95 % confidence interval 0.46 to 0.94 ; P = 0.021 ; number needed to treat 30 ) and 29 % fewer participants had regular symptoms ( odds ratio 0.71 , 0.56 to 0.90 ; P = 0.05 ) . NHS costs were 84.70 pounds sterling ( 74.90 pounds sterling to 93.91 pounds sterling ) greater per participant in the eradication group over 2 years , of which 83.40 pounds sterling ( 146 dollars ; 121 euro ) was the cost of eradication treatment . No difference in quality of life existed between the 2 groups . Community screening and eradication of H pylori is feasible in the general population and led to significant reductions in the number of people who consulted for dyspepsia and had symptoms 2 years after treatment . These benefits have to be balanced against the costs of eradication treatment , so a targeted eradication strategy in dyspeptic patients may be preferable .
