Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting by metoclopramide combined with dexamethasone : randomised double blind multicentre trial . To determine whether 10 mg , 25 mg , or 50 mg metoclopramide combined with 8 mg dexamethasone , given intraoperatively , is more effective in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting than 8 mg dexamethasone alone , and to assess benefit in relation to adverse drug reactions . 4 -armed , parallel group , double blind , randomised controlled clinical trial . 4 clinics of a university hospital and 4 district hospitals in Germany . 3140 patients who received balanced or regional anaesthesia during surgery . Postoperative nausea and vomiting within 24 hours of surgery ( primary end point ) ; occurrence of adverse reactions . Cumulative incidences ( 95 % confidence intervals ) of postoperative nausea and vomiting were 23.1 % ( 20.2 % to 26.0 % ) , 20.6 % ( 17.8 % to 23.4 % ) , 17.2 % ( 14.6 % to 19.8 % ) , and 14.5 % ( 12.0 % to 17.0 % ) for 0 mg , 10 mg , 25 mg , and 50 mg metoclopramide . In the secondary analysis , 25 mg and 50 mg metoclopramide were equally effective at preventing early nausea ( 0 -12 hours ) , but only 50 mg reduced late nausea and vomiting ( > 12 hours ) . The most frequent adverse drug reactions were hypotension and tachycardia , with cumulative incidences of 8.8 % ( 6.8 % to 10.8 % ) , 11.2 % ( 9.0 % to 13.4 % ) , 12.9 % ( 10.5 % to 15.3 % ) , and 17.9 % ( 15.2 % to 20.6 % ) for 0 mg , 10 mg , 25 mg , and 50 mg metoclopramide . The addition of 50 mg metoclopramide to 8 mg dexamethasone ( given intraoperatively ) is an effective , safe , and cheap way to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting . A reduced dose of 25 mg metoclopramide intraoperatively , with additional postoperative prophylaxis in high risk patients , may be equally effective and cause fewer adverse drug reactions .
