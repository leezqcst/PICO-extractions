Comparison of laparoscopic and mini incision open donor nephrectomy : single blind , randomised controlled clinical trial . To determine the best approach for live donor nephrectomy to minimise discomfort to the donor and to provide good graft function . Single blind , randomised controlled trial . 2 university medical centres , the Netherlands . 100 living kidney donors . Participants were randomly assigned to either laparoscopic donor nephrectomy or to mini incision muscle splitting open donor nephrectomy . The primary outcome was physical fatigue using the multidimensional fatigue inventory 20 ( MFI-20 ) . Secondary outcomes were physical function using the SF-36 , hospital stay after surgery , pain , operating times , recipient graft function , and graft survival . Conversions did not occur . Compared with mini incision open donor nephrectomy , laparoscopic donor nephrectomy resulted in longer skin to skin time ( median 221 v 164 minutes , P < 0.001 ) , longer warm ischaemia time ( 6 v 3 minutes , P < 0.001 ) , less blood loss ( 100 v 240 ml , P < 0.001 ) , and a similar number of complications ( intraoperatively 12 % v 6 % , P = 0.49 , postoperatively both 6 % ) . After laparoscopic nephrectomy , donors required less morphine ( 16 v 25 mg , P = 0.005 ) and shorter hospital stay ( 3 v 4 days , P = 0.003 ) . During 1 year 's follow - up mean physical fatigue was less ( difference - 1.3 , 95 % confidence interval - 2.4 to - 0.1 ) and physical function was better ( difference 6.2 , 2.0 to 10.3 ) after laparoscopic nephrectomy . Function of the graft and graft survival rate of the recipient at 1 year censored for death did not differ ( 100 % after laparoscopic nephrectomy and 98 % after open nephrectomy ) . Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy results in a better quality of life compared with mini incision open donor nephrectomy but equal safety and graft function .
