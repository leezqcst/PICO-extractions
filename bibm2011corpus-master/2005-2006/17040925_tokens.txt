Effect of baseline serum albumin concentration on outcome of resuscitation with albumin or saline in patients in intensive care units : analysis of data from the saline versus albumin fluid evaluation ( SAFE ) study . To determine whether outcomes of resuscitation with albumin or saline in the intensive care unit depend on patients ' baseline serum albumin concentration . Analysis of data from a double blind , randomised controlled trial . Intensive care units of 16 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand . 6045 participants in the saline versus albumin fluid evaluation ( SAFE ) study . Fluid resuscitation with 4 % albumin or saline in patients with a baseline serum albumin concentration of 25 g /l or less or more than 25 g / l . Primary outcome was all cause mortality at 28 days . Secondary outcomes were length of stay in the intensive care unit , length of stay in hospital , duration of renal replacement therapy , and duration of mechanical ventilation . The odds ratios for death for albumin compared with saline for patients with a baseline serum albumin concentration of 25 g /l or less and more than 25 g /l were 0.87 and 1.09 , respectively ( ratio of odds ratios 0.80 , 95 % confidence interval 0.63 to 1.02 ) ; P = 0.08 for heterogeneity . No significant interaction was found between baseline serum albumin concentration as a continuous variable and the effect of albumin and saline on mortality . No consistent interaction was found between baseline serum albumin concentration and treatment effects on length of stay in the intensive care unit , length of hospital stay , duration of renal replacement therapy , or duration of mechanical ventilation . The outcomes of resuscitation with albumin and saline are similar irrespective of patients ' baseline serum albumin concentration . ISRCTN76588 266 .
