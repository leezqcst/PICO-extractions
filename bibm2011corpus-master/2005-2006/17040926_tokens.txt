Self management of arthritis in primary care : randomised controlled trial . To evaluate clinical effectiveness of a self management programme for arthritis in patients in primary care with osteoarthritis . Randomised controlled trial . 74 general practices in the United Kingdom . 812 patients aged 50 and over with osteoarthritis of hips or knees ( or both ) and pain or disability ( or both ) . Participants were randomised to 6 sessions of self management of arthritis and an education booklet ( intervention group ) or the education booklet alone ( control group ) . Primary outcome was quality of life , as assessed by the short form health survey ( SF-36 ) . Several other physical and psychosocial secondary outcomes were assessed . Data were collected at baseline , 4 months , and 12 months . Response rates were 80 % and 76 % at 4 and 12 months . The 2 groups showed significant differences at 12 months on the anxiety subscore of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( mean difference - 0.62 , 95 % confidence interval - 1.08 to - 0.16 ) , arthritis self efficacy scale for pain ( 0.98 , 0.07 to 1.89 ) , and self efficacy for other aspects of management ( 1.58 , 0.25 to 2.90 ) . Results were similar for intention to treat and per protocol analyses . No significant difference was seen in number of visits to the general practitioner at 12 months . The self management of arthritis programme reduced anxiety and improved participants ' perceived self efficacy to manage symptoms , but it had no significant effect on pain , physical functioning , or contact with primary care .
