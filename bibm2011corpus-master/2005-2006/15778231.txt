Effects of acupuncture and stabilising exercises as adjunct to standard treatment in pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain : randomised single blind controlled trial . To compare the efficacy of standard treatment , standard treatment plus acupuncture , and standard treatment plus stabilising exercises for pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy . Randomised single blind controlled trial . Settings East Hospital , Gothenburg , and 27 maternity care centres in Sweden . 386 pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain . Treatment for 6 weeks with standard treatment ( n = 130 ) , standard treatment plus acupuncture ( n = 125 ) , or standard treatment plus stabilising exercises ( n = 131 ) . Primary outcome measure was pain ( visual analogue scale ) ; secondary outcome measure was assessment of severity of pelvic girdle pain by an independent examiner before and after treatment . After treatment the stabilising exercise group had less pain than the standard group in the morning ( median difference = 9 , 95 % confidence interval 1.7 to 12.8 ; P = 0.0312 ) and in the evening ( 13 , 2.7 to 17.5 ; P = 0.0245 ) . The acupuncture group , in turn , had less pain in the evening than the stabilising exercise group ( -14 , - 18.1 to - 3.3 ; P = 0.0130 ) . Furthermore , the acupuncture group had less pain than the standard treatment group in the morning ( 12 , 5.9 to 17.3 ; P < 0.001 ) and in the evening ( 27 , 13.3 to 29.5 ; P < 0.001 ) . Attenuation of pelvic girdle pain as assessed by the independent examiner was greatest in the acupuncture group . Acupuncture and stabilising exercises constitute efficient complements to standard treatment for the management of pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy . Acupuncture was superior to stabilising exercises in this study .
