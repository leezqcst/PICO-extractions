Cost effectiveness of nurse led secondary prevention clinics for coronary heart disease in primary care : follow up of a randomised controlled trial . To establish the cost effectiveness of nurse led secondary prevention clinics for coronary heart disease based on 4 years ' follow up of a randomised controlled trial . Cost effectiveness analysis . 19 general practices in north east Scotland . 1343 patients ( 673 in intervention group and 670 in control group , as originally randomised ) aged under 80 years with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease but without terminal illness or dementia and not housebound . Nurse led clinics to promote medical and lifestyle components of secondary prevention . Costs of clinics ; overall costs to health service ; and cost per life year and per quality adjusted life year ( QALY ) gained , expressed as incremental gain in intervention group compared with control group . The cost of the intervention ( clinics and drugs ) was 136 pounds sterling ( 254 dollars ; 195 euros ) per patient higher ( 1998 -9 prices ) in the intervention group , but the difference in other NHS costs , although lower for the intervention group , was not statistically significant . Overall , 28 fewer deaths occurred in the intervention group leading to a gain in mean life years per patient of 0.110 and of 0.124 QALYs . The incremental cost per life year saved was 1236 pounds sterling and that per QALY was 1097 pounds sterling . Nurse led clinics for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care seem to be cost effective compared with most interventions in health care , with the main gains in life years saved .
