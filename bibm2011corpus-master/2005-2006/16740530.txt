Randomised , controlled trial of alternating pressure mattresses compared with alternating pressure overlays for the prevention of pressure ulcers : PRESSURE ( pressure relieving support surfaces ) trial . To compare whether differences exist between alternating pressure overlays and alternating pressure mattresses in the development of new pressure ulcers , healing of existing pressure ulcers , and patient acceptability . Pragmatic , open , multicentre , randomised controlled trial . 11 hospitals in 6 NHS trusts . 1972 people admitted to hospital as acute or elective patients . Participants were randomised to an alternating pressure mattress ( n = 982 ) or an alternating pressure overlay ( n = 990 ) . The proportion of participants developing a new pressure ulcer of grade 2 or worse ; time to development of new pressure ulcers ; proportions of participants developing a new ulcer within 30 days ; healing of existing pressure ulcers ; and patient acceptability . Intention to treat analysis found no difference in the proportions of participants developing a new pressure ulcer of grade 2 or worse ( 10.7 % overlay patients , 10.3 % mattress patients ; difference 0.4 % , 95 % confidence interval --2.3 % to 3.1 % , P = 0.75 ) . More overlay patients requested change owing to dissatisfaction ( 23.3 % ) than mattress patients ( 18.9 % , P = 0.02 ) . No difference was found between alternating pressure mattresses and alternating pressure overlays in the proportion of people who develop a pressure ulcer . ISRCTN 78646179 .
