Effect on weight gain of routinely giving albendazole to preschool children during child health days in Uganda : cluster randomised controlled trial . To estimate the effectiveness of delivering an anthelmintic through a community child health programme on the weight gain of preschool children in Uganda . Cluster randomised controlled trial . Eastern Uganda . 48 parishes participating in a new programme for child health : 24 offered children an additional service of anthelmintic treatment . The outcome is based on measurements from 27 , 995 children . Treatment of children aged between 1 and 7 years with 400 mg albendazole added to standard services offered during child health days over a 3 year period . Weight gain . The provision of periodic anthelmintic treatment as a part of child health services in Uganda resulted in an increase in weight gain of about 10 % ( 166 g per child per year , 95 % confidence interval 16 to 316 ) above expected weight gain when treatments were given twice a year , and an increase of 5 % when the treatment was given annually . Deworming of preschool children in Uganda as part of regularly scheduled health services seems practical and associated with increased weight gain .
