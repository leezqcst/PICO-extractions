Randomised study of effect of different doses of vitamin A on childhood morbidity and mortality . To determine whether the dose of vitamin A currently recommended by the World Health Organization or half this dose gives better protection against childhood morbidity and mortality . Randomised study . A combined oral polio vaccine and vitamin A supplementation campaign in Guinea-Bissau , Africa . 4983 children aged 6 months to 5 years . 1 of 2 doses of vitamin A ( recommended and half ) ; oral polio vaccine . Mortality and morbidity at 6 and 9 months . Mortality was lower in the children who took half the recommended dose of vitamin A compared with the full dose at both 6 months ( mortality rate ratio 0.69 , 95 % confidence interval 0.36 to 1.35 ) and 9 months ( 0.62 , 0.36 to 1.06 ) of follow - up . There was a significant interaction between sex and dose , the lower dose being associated with significantly reduced mortality in girls ( 0.19 , 0.06 to 0.66 ) but not in boys ( 1.98 , 0.74 to 5.29 ) . The lower dose of vitamin A was consistently associated with lower hospital case fatality in girls ( 0.19 , 0.02 to 1.45 ) . Paradoxically , in children aged 6-18 months , the low dose was associated with slightly higher morbidity . Half the dose of vitamin A currently recommended by WHO may provide equally good or better protection against mortality but not against morbidity .
