Single blind , randomised , comparative study of the Bug Buster kit and over the counter pediculicide treatments against head lice in the United Kingdom . To compare the effectiveness of the Bug Buster kit with a single treatment of over the counter pediculicides for eliminating head lice . Single blind , multicentre , randomised , comparative clinical study . 4 counties in England and 1 county in Scotland . 133 young people aged 2-15 years with head louse infestation : 56 were allocated to the Bug Buster kit and 70 to pediculicides treatment . Home use of proprietary pediculicides ( organophosphate or pyrethroid ) or the Bug Buster kit . Presence of head lice 2-4 days after end of treatment : day 5 for the pediculicides and day 15 for the Bug Buster kit . The cure rate using the Bug Buster kit was significantly greater than that for the pediculicides ( 57 % v 13 % ; relative risk 4.4 , 95 % confidence interval 2.3 to 8.5 ) . Number needed to treat for the Bug Buster kit compared with the pediculicides was 2.26 . The Bug Buster kit was the most effective over the counter treatment for head louse infestation in the community when compared with pediculicides .
