Cluster randomised trial of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants in area of high , seasonal transmission in Ghana . To evaluate the effects of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants ( IPTi ) with sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine in an area of intense , seasonal transmission . Cluster randomised placebo controlled trial , with 96 clusters allocated randomly to sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine or placebo in blocks of 8 . Children received sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine or placebo and 1 month of iron supplementation when they received DPT-2 , DPT-3 , or measles vaccinations and at 12 months of age . Incidence of malaria and of anaemia determined through passive case detection . 89 % ( 1103 / 1242 ) of children in the placebo group and 88 % ( 1088 / 1243 ) in the IPTi group completed follow - up to 24 months of age . The protective efficacy of IPTi against all episodes of malaria was 24.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval 14.3 % to 34.0 % ) up to 15 months of age . IPTi had no protective effect against malaria between 16 and 24 months of age ( protective efficacy - 4.9 % , - 21.3 % to 9.3 % ) . The incidence of high parasite density malaria ( > or = 5000 parasites / mul) was higher in the IPTi group than in the placebo group between 16 and 24 months of age ( protective efficacy - 19.5 % , - 39.8 % to - 2.2 % ) . IPTi reduced hospital admissions with anaemia by 35.1 % ( 10.5 % to 52.9 % ) up to 15 months of age . IPTi had no significant effect on anaemia between 16 and 24 months of age ( protective efficacy - 6.4 % , - 76.8 % to 35.9 % ) . The relative risk of death up to 15 months of age in the IPTi group was 1.26 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.81 to 1.96 ; P = 0.31 ) , and from 16 to 24 months it was 1.28 ( 0.77 to 2.14 ; P = 0.35 ) . Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria with sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine can reduce malaria and anaemia in infants even in seasonal , high transmission areas , but concern exists about possible rebound in the incidence of malaria in the second year of life .
