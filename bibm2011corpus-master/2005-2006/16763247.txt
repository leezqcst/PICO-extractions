Effectiveness of discontinuing antibiotic treatment after 3 days versus 8 days in mild to moderate - severe community acquired pneumonia : randomised , double blind study . To compare the effectiveness of discontinuing treatment with amoxicillin after 3 days or 8 days in adults admitted to hospital with mild to moderate - severe community acquired pneumonia who substantially improved after an initial 3 days ' treatment . Randomised , double blind , placebo controlled non - inferiority trial . 9 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands . Adults with mild to moderate - severe community acquired pneumonia ( pneumonia severity index score < or = 110 ) . Patients who had substantially improved after 3 days ' treatment with intravenous amoxicillin were randomly assigned to oral amoxicillin ( n = 63 ) or placebo ( n = 56 ) 3 times daily for 5 days . The primary outcome measure was the clinical success rate at day 10 . Secondary outcome measures were the clinical success rate at day 28 , symptom resolution , radiological success rates at days 10 and 28 , and adverse events . Baseline characteristics were comparable , with the exception of symptom severity , which was worse in the 3 day treatment group . In the 3 day and 8 day treatment groups the clinical success rate at day 10 was 93 % for both ( difference 0.1 % , 95 % confidence interval --9 % to 10 % ) and at day 28 was 90 % compared with 88 % ( difference 2.0 %, --9 % to 15 % ) . Both groups had similar resolution of symptoms . Radiological success rates were 86 % compared with 83 % at day 10 ( difference 3 %, --10 % to 16 % ) and 86 % compared with 79 % at day 28 ( difference 6 %, --7 % to 20 % ) . 6 patients ( 11 % ) in the placebo group and 13 patients ( 21 % ) in the active treatment group reported adverse events ( P = 0.1 ) . Discontinuing amoxicillin treatment after 3 days is not inferior to discontinuing it after 8 days in adults admitted to hospital with mild to moderate - severe community acquired pneumonia who substantially improved after an initial 3 days ' treatment .
