Cost effectiveness of treatment for alcohol problems : findings of the randomised UK alcohol treatment trial ( UKATT ) . To compare the cost effectiveness of social behaviour and network therapy , a new treatment for alcohol problems > , with that of the proved motivational enhancement therapy . Cost effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic randomised trial . 7 treatment sites around Birmingham , Cardiff , and Leeds . 742 clients with alcohol problems ; 617 ( 83.2 % ) were interviewed at 12 months and full economic data were obtained on 608 ( 98.5 % of 617 ) . Main economic measures Quality adjusted life years ( QALYs ) , costs of trial treatments , and consequences for public sector resources ( health care , other alcohol treatment , social services , and criminal justice services ) . Both therapies saved about 5 times as much in expenditure on health , social , and criminal justice services as they cost . Neither net savings nor cost effectiveness differed significantly between the therapies , despite the average cost of social behaviour and network therapy ( 221 pounds sterling ; 385 dollars ; 320 euros ) being significantly more than that of motivational enhancement therapy ( 129 pounds sterling ) . If a QALY were worth 30,000 pounds sterling , then the motivational therapy would have 58 % chance of being more cost effective than the social therapy , and the social therapy would have 42 % chance of being more cost effective than the motivational therapy . Participants reported highly significant reductions in drinking and associated problems and costs . The novel social behaviour and network therapy did not differ significantly in cost effectiveness from the proved motivational enhancement therapy .
