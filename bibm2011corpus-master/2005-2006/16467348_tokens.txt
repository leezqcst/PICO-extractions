Oral protein energy supplements for children with cystic fibrosis : CALICO multicentre randomised controlled trial . To determine whether oral protein energy supplements , used long term in children with cystic fibrosis who are moderately malnourished , improve nutritional and other outcomes . Multicentre randomised controlled trial . 7 specialist paediatric cystic fibrosis centres and their associated shared care clinics and 7 smaller paediatric cystic fibrosis clinics . 102 children with cystic fibrosis , aged between 2 and 15 years , who were moderately malnourished . Oral protein energy supplements in addition to usual dietary advice compared with dietary advice alone , for 12 months . Change in body mass index centile over 1 year . Use of supplements was not associated with a change in body mass index centile ( mean difference 2.99 centile points , 95 % confidence interval - 2.70 to 8.68 ) or other nutritional and spirometric outcomes in this group of children . Long term use of oral protein energy supplements did not result in an improvement in nutritional status or other clinical outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis who were moderately malnourished . Oral protein energy supplements should not be regarded as an essential part of the management of this group of children . ISRCTN : 95744468 .
