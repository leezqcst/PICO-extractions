Antenatal betamethasone and incidence of neonatal respiratory distress after elective caesarean section : pragmatic randomised trial . To test whether steroids reduce respiratory distress in babies born by elective caesarean section at term . Multicentre pragmatic randomised trial . 10 maternity units . 998 consenting women randomised at decision to deliver by elective caesarean section ; 503 randomised to treatment group . The treatment group received 2 intramuscular doses of 12 mg betamethasone in the 48 hours before delivery . The control group received treatment as usual . The primary outcome was admission to special care baby unit with respiratory distress . Secondary outcomes were severity of respiratory distress and level of care in response . Sex , birth weight , and gestation were not different between the 2 groups . Of the 35 babies admitted to special baby units with respiratory distress , 24 were in the control group and 11 in the intervention group ( P = 0.02 ) . The incidence of admission with respiratory distress was 0.051 in the control group and 0.024 in the treatment group ( relative risk 0.46 , 95 % confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93 ) . The incidence of transient tachypnoea of the newborn was 0.040 in the control group and 0.021 in the treatment group ( 0.54 , 0.26 to 1.12 ) . The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was 0.011 in the control group and 0.002 in the treatment group ( 0.21 , 0.03 to 1.32 ) . Antenatal betamethasone and delaying delivery until 39 weeks both reduce admissions to special care baby units with respiratory distress after elective caesarean section at term .
