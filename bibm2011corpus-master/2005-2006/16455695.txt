Oral misoprostol for induction of labour at term : randomised controlled trial . To compare oral misoprostol solution with vaginal prostaglandin gel ( dinoprostone ) for induction of labour at term to determine whether misoprostol is superior . Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial . Maternity departments in 3 hospitals in Australia . Population Pregnant women with a singleton cephalic presentation at > or = 36+6 weeks ' gestation , with an indication for prostaglandin induction of labour . 20 mug oral misoprostol solution at ourly intervals and placebo vaginal gel or vaginal dinoprostone gel at 6 hourly intervals and placebo oral solution . Vaginal birth within 24 hours ; uterine hyperstimulation with associated changes in fetal heart rate ; caesarean section ( all ) ; and caesarean section for fetal distress . 741 women were randomised , 365 to the misoprostol group and 376 to the vaginal dinoprostone group . There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in the primary outcomes : vaginal birth not achieved in 24 hours ( misoprostol 168 / 365 ( 46.0 % ) v dinoprostone 155 / 376 ( 41.2 % ) ; relative risk 1.12 , 95 % confidence interval 0.95 to 1.32 ; P = 0.134 ) , caesarean section ( 83 / 365 ( 22.7 % ) v 100 / 376 ( 26.6 % ) ; 0.82 , 0.64 to 1.06 ; P = 0.127 ) , caesarean section for fetal distress ( 32 / 365 ( 8.8 % ) v 35 / 376 ( 9.3 % ) ; 0.91 , 0.57 to 1.44 ; P = 0.679 ) , or uterine hyperstimulation with changes in fetal heart rate ( 3 / 365 ( 0.8 % ) v 6 / 376 ( 1.6 % ) ; 0.55 , 0.14 to 2.21 ; P = 0.401 ) . Although there were differences in the process of labour induction , there were no significant differences in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes . This trial shows no evidence that oral misoprostol is superior to vaginal dinoprostone for induction of labour . However , it does not lead to poorer health outcomes for women or their infants , and oral treatment is preferred by women . National Health and Medical Research Council , Perinatal Trials , PT0361 .
