Incidence and risk factors for non - alcoholic steatohepatitis : prospective study of 5408 women enrolled in Italian tamoxifen chemoprevention trial . To assess the incidence , cofactors , and excess risk of development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , including non - alcoholic steatohepatitis , attributable to tamoxifen in women . Prospective , randomised , double blind , placebo controlled trial . 5408 healthy women who had had hysterectomies , recruited into the Italian tamoxifen chemoprevention trial from 58 centres in Italy . Women were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen ( 20 mg daily ) or placebo for 5 years . Development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in all women with normal baseline liver function who showed at least 2 elevations of alanine aminotransferase ( > or = 1.5 times upper limit of normal ) over a 6 month period . During follow up , 64 women met the predefined criteria : 12 tested positive for hepatitis C virus , and the remaining 52 were suspected of having developed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( 34 tamoxifen , 18 placebo )--hazard ratio = 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.1 to 3.5 ; P = 0.04 ) . In all 52 women ultrasonography confirmed the presence of fatty liver . Other factors associated with the development of non - alcoholic fatty liver disease included overweight ( 2.4 , 1.2 to 4.8 ) , obesity ( 3.6 , 1.7 to 7.6 ) , hypercholesterolaemia ( 3.4 , 1.4 to 7.8 ) , and arterial hypertension ( 2.0 , 1.0 to 3.8 ) . 20 women had liver biopsies : 15 were diagnosed as having mild to moderate steatohepatitis ( 12 tamoxifen , 3 placebo ) , and 5 had fatty liver alone ( 1 tamoxifen , 4 placebo ) . No clinical , biochemical , ultrasonic , or histological signs suggestive of progression to cirrhosis were observed after a median follow up of 8.7 years . Tamoxifen was associated with higher risk of development of non - alcoholic steatohepatitis only in overweight and obese women with features of metabolic syndrome , but the disease , in both the tamoxifen and the placebo group , after 10 years of follow up seems to be indolent .
