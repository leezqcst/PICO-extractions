Surgical stabilisation of the spine compared with a programme of intensive rehabilitation for the management of patients with chronic low back pain : cost utility analysis based on a randomised controlled trial . To determine whether , from a health provider and patient perspective , surgical stabilisation of the spine is cost effective when compared with an intensive programme of rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain . Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial . Secondary care . 349 patients randomised to surgery ( n = 176 ) or to an intensive rehabilitation programme ( n = 173 ) from 15 centres across the United Kingdom between June 1996 and February 2002 . Costs related to back pain and incurred by the NHS and patients up to 24 months after randomisation . Return to paid employment and total hours worked . Patient utility as estimated by using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire at several time points and used to calculate quality adjusted life years ( QALYs ) . Cost effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost per QALY . At 2 years , 38 patients randomised to rehabilitation had received rehabilitation and surgery whereas just 7 surgery patients had received both treatments . The mean total cost per patient was estimated to be 7830 pounds sterling ( SD 5202 pounds sterling ) in the surgery group and 4526 pounds sterling ( SD 4155 pounds sterling ) in the intensive rehabilitation arm , a significant difference of 3304 pounds sterling ( 95 % confidence interval 2317 pounds sterling to 4291 pounds sterling ) . Mean QALYs over the trial period were 1.004 ( SD 0.405 ) in the surgery group and 0.936 ( SD 0.431 ) in the intensive rehabilitation group , giving a non - significant difference of 0.068 ( - 0.020 to 0.156 ) . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was estimated to be 48,588 pounds sterling per QALY gained ( - 279,883 pounds sterling to 372,406 pounds sterling ) . 2 year follow - up data show that surgical stabilisation of the spine may not be a cost effective use of scarce healthcare resources . However , sensitivity analyses show that this could change - for example , if the proportion of rehabilitation patients requiring subsequent surgery continues to increase .
